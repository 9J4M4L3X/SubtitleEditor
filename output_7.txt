1
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,320
I believe in America.

2
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,190
America has made my fortune

3
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:25,293
and I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:29,728
I gave her freedom,
but I taught her

5
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,333
never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:36,434
She found a boyfriend.
Not an Italian.

7
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,852
She went to the movies with him.

8
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:41,970
She stayed out late.
I didn't protest.

9
00:01:43,747 --> 00:01:46,580
Two months ago,
he took her for a drive

10
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:49,183
with another boyfriend.

11
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,148
They made her drink whiskey,

12
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:55,453
and then they tried
to take advantage of her.

13
00:01:56,693 --> 00:01:58,838
She resisted.

14
00:01:58,862 --> 00:02:01,362
She kept her honor.

15
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,125
So they beat her like an animal.

16
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:10,768
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken...

17
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:14,187
her jaw was shattered...

18
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:16,711
held together by wire.

19
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:21,309
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

20
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:27,646
But I wept. Why did I weep?

21
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:32,827
She was the light of my life.

22
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:37,198
Beautiful girl.

23
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,670
Now she will never
be beautiful again.

24
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:52,313
Sorry.

25
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:02,957
I, I went to the police,
like a good American.

26
00:03:04,027 --> 00:03:06,527
These two boys
were brought to trial.

27
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:10,595
A judge sentence them
to three years in prison...

28
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:13,201
and suspend their sentence.

29
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:16,504
Suspended the sentence.

30
00:03:16,573 --> 00:03:19,073
They went free that very day.

31
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:23,745
I stood in the courtroom
like a fool.

32
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:27,880
And those two bastard,
they smiled at me.

33
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:32,889
Then I said to my wife,
"For justice...

34
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,490
we must go to Don Corleone."

35
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:43,696
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

36
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:46,679
What do you want of me?

37
00:03:46,703 --> 00:03:49,797
Tell me anything,
but do what I beg you to do.

38
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:53,508
What is that?

39
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,901
That I cannot do.

40
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:22,904
I'll give you anything you ask.

41
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:28,073
We've known each other many years,
but this is the first time...

42
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:31,511
you ever came to me
for counsel or for help.

43
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,550
I can't remember the last time
that you invited me...

44
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:37,151
to your house
for a cup of coffee...

45
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:41,885
even though my wife
is godmother to your only child.

46
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:44,237
But let's be frank.

47
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:46,761
You never wanted my friendship...

48
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:50,893
and you were afraid
to be in my debt.

49
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:53,501
I didn't want
to get into trouble.

50
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:57,105
I understand.

51
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:00,007
You found paradise in America.

52
00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:04,791
You had a good trade,
you made a good living.

53
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:07,511
Police protected you,
and there were courts of law.

54
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:10,118
So you didn't need
a friend like me.

55
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:15,516
But, now you come to me
and you say,

56
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:18,126
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

57
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:22,730
But you don't ask with respect.

58
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,393
You don't offer friendship.

59
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:28,002
You don't even think
to call me 'Godfather.'

60
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:30,917
Instead, you come into my house

61
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:32,919
on the day my daughter
is to be married

62
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:35,443
and you ask me to do murder
for money.

63
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,840
I ask you for justice.

64
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:41,679
That is not justice.
Your daughter is still alive.

65
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:46,353
They must suffer then
as she suffers.

66
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:50,925
How much shall I pay you?

67
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:07,975
Bonasera. Bonasera.

68
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:12,880
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

69
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:17,245
If you'd come to me
in friendship,

70
00:06:17,354 --> 00:06:19,332
then the scum
that ruined your daughter

71
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:21,856
would be suffering
this very day.

72
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:24,070
And if, by chance,

73
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:26,139
an honest man like yourself
should make enemies,

74
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:28,663
then they would become
my enemies.

75
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:33,267
And then they would fear you.

76
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:39,841
Be my friend?

77
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,780
Godfather.

78
00:06:49,353 --> 00:06:51,853
Good.

79
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:54,867
Someday, and that day
may never come...

80
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,391
I'll call upon you
to do a service for me.

81
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:01,696
But until that day...

82
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:05,958
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

83
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:09,937
<i>- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego</i>

84
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,480
Give this to Clemenza.

85
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:23,396
I want reliable people,

86
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,598
people that aren't
going to be carried away.

87
00:07:25,622 --> 00:07:27,133
I mean, we're not murderers,

88
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:29,717
in spite of what
this undertaker says.

89
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:56,696
- Where's Michael?
- What? Don't worry.

90
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,464
It's early. He'll be here.

91
00:07:58,488 --> 00:07:59,699
We're not taking it.

92
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:02,223
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

93
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:04,724
<i>No picture now.</i>

94
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:11,098
- What's the matter, Sonny?
- It's Michael.

95
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:03,617
Don Barzini.

96
00:09:06,118 --> 00:09:08,118
<i>Welcome to our house.</i>

97
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:22,464
Hey, Paulie!
Let me have some wine.

98
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:25,132
Paulie! More wine.

99
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:26,486
<i>Scusi, please.</i>

100
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,321
You look terrif on the floor.

101
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:30,845
What are you,
a dance judge or something?

102
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:34,348
Go take a walk around
the neighborhood. Do your job.

103
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,870
Hey, Sandra, come on. Do me a favor.
Watch the kids.

104
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:46,854
- Don't let 'em run wild, all right?
- Well, you watch yourself, all right?

105
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,297
Twenty or thirty grand.

106
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:13,821
In small bills, cash.

107
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,657
In that little silk purse.

108
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:19,593
If this was
somebody else's wedding.

109
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:23,061
<i>Hey, Paulie!
I got two gobbagool...</i>

110
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,011
<i>gabagol and a prosciutto.</i>

111
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:27,535
Stupid jerk!

112
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:38,245
Hey, what's the matter?

113
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:52,204
- I have to go back to work.
- Oh, Tom.

114
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:53,539
It's part of the wedding.

115
00:10:53,563 --> 00:10:56,464
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

116
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:04,817
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

117
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:07,341
that you have invited me
to your home...

118
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,192
Get outta here.

119
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,716
This is a private party. Go on.

120
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:19,153
What is it?
Hey, my sister's wedding.

121
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:28,729
Goddamn FBI
don't respect nothin'.

122
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,700
Hey, come here, come here.
Come here!

123
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:38,572
There.

124
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:51,564
But towards the end
he was paroled...

125
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:54,216
to help with
the American war effort.

126
00:11:54,324 --> 00:11:56,824
For the last six months, he's been
working at my pastry shop.

127
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:59,572
Nazorine, my friend,
what can I do for you?

128
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:02,096
Now that the war is over...

129
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:05,225
this boy, Enzo, they want
to repatriate him back to Italy.

130
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:08,896
Godfather, I have a daughter.

131
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:11,505
See, she and Enzo...

132
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,487
You want Enzo to stay
in this country...

133
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:17,011
and you want your daughter
to be married.

134
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:20,581
You understand everything.

135
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:23,784
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

136
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:28,334
And wait till you see
the beautiful wedding cake...

137
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:29,769
I made for your daughter.

138
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:32,353
Like this, with the bride
and the groom and...

139
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:41,695
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

140
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:46,000
Give it to a Jew congressman
in another district.

141
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:49,643
Who else is on the list?

142
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:57,963
Hey, Michael. How are you?

143
00:12:57,987 --> 00:13:00,487
Hello.

144
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:19,903
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

145
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:28,661
Is this... Is this necessary?

146
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:30,596
He didn't expect to be invited
to the wedding...

147
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,665
so he wanted to thank you.

148
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:34,366
All right.

149
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,621
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

150
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:40,227
that you have invited me
to your home...

151
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,830
on the wedding day
of your daughter.

152
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,733
And may their first child
be a masculine child.

153
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:48,360
- Don...
- Michael?

154
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:50,015
Don Corleone...

155
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,539
That man over there
is talking to himself.

156
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:55,943
See that scary guy over there?

157
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,757
He's a very scary guy.

158
00:13:57,781 --> 00:14:00,092
Who is he? What's his name?

159
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:02,710
His name is Luca Brasi...

160
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:05,319
and he helps my father out
sometimes.

161
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:08,595
Oh, Michael, wait a minute.
He's coming over here.

162
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:09,596
Mike!

163
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,097
Ho! Tom.

164
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:12,621
Heyyy!

165
00:14:13,797 --> 00:14:15,674
You look terrific!

166
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:17,877
My brother Tom Hagen.
This is Kay Adams.

167
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:20,426
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

168
00:14:20,537 --> 00:14:22,882
Your father's
been asking for you.

169
00:14:22,906 --> 00:14:24,626
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

170
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,150
I'll be there.

171
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,206
If he's your brother,
why does he have a different name?

172
00:14:31,314 --> 00:14:33,292
Oh, uh, when my brother Sonny was a kid...

173
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:35,816
he found Tom Hagen in the street,
and he had no home.

174
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:39,219
And so my father took him in...

175
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:42,289
and he's been with us ever since.

176
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:45,492
He's a good lawyer.

177
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,274
Not a Sicilian, but...

178
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:50,609
I think he's gonna be consigliere.

179
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:53,133
- What's that?
- That's...

180
00:14:53,703 --> 00:14:55,381
like a counselor, an advisor.

181
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:57,905
Very important to the family.

182
00:14:58,474 --> 00:15:00,974
You like your lasagne?

183
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:09,885
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

184
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:13,217
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding...

185
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:21,328
on the day
of your daughter's wedding.

186
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:25,098
And I hope
that their first child...

187
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:27,701
be a masculine child.

188
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:33,566
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

189
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:37,423
For your daughter's
bridal purse.

190
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:40,439
Thank you, Luca,
my most valued friend.

191
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,008
Don Corleone,
I'm gonna leave you now...

192
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,165
because I know you are busy.

193
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:48,689
Thank you.

194
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:55,179
Senator Cauly apologized
for not coming personally...

195
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,784
but said you'd understand.

196
00:17:58,121 --> 00:18:00,621
Also some of the judges.

197
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:03,624
They've all sent gifts.

198
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:07,961
What is that outside?

199
00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:18,600
Johnny!

200
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:24,044
I love you.

201
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,747
Hey, Johnny, look over here!

202
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:35,585
He came all the way from California
to come to the wedding.

203
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:37,931
- I told you he was going to come.
- It's been two years.

204
00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:40,455
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

205
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:47,034
Sing a song.

206
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:04,084
Michael, you never told me
you knew Johnny Fontane.

207
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:08,146
- Sure. You wanna meet him?
- Huh? Oh, well, sure.

208
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:10,302
My father helped him
with his career.

209
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:13,420
- For my Connie.
- He did? How?

210
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:15,274
<i>I have but one</i>

211
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:17,232
- Let's listen to the song.
- No, Michael

212
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,844
<i>Heart</i>

213
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:22,565
<i>This heart I bring you</i>

214
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:28,507
<i>I have but one heart</i>

215
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:31,111
<i>To share with you</i>

216
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:37,849
<i>I have but one dream</i>

217
00:19:37,954 --> 00:19:41,549
<i>That I can cling to</i>

218
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:47,724
<i>You are the one dream</i>

219
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,095
<i>I pray comes true</i>

220
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:54,213
Please, Michael. Tell me.

221
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:57,900
<i>My darling, until I saw you</i>

222
00:19:58,007 --> 00:19:59,985
Well, when Johnny was first starting out...

223
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:02,876
he was signed to this
personal service contract...

224
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:05,479
with a big bandleader.

225
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:07,960
And as his career
got better and better...

226
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:10,484
he wanted to get out of it.

227
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:13,883
Now, Johnny is
my father's godson...

228
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,490
and my father went
to see this bandleader...

229
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,926
and he offered him
$10,000 to let Johnny go.

230
00:20:21,397 --> 00:20:23,897
But the bandleader said no.

231
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,360
So the next day
my father went to see him...

232
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,970
only this time with Luca Brasi.

233
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:34,701
And within an hour,
he signed a release...

234
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:39,474
for a certified check of $1,000.

235
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,327
How'd he do that?

236
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:44,876
My father made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

237
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:48,822
What was that?

238
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,654
Luca Brasi
held a gun to his head...

239
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:54,006
and my father assured him
that either his brains...

240
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,530
or his signature
would be on the contract.

241
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:04,604
That's a true story.

242
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:17,484
That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.

243
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,833
Beautiful!

244
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:43,121
My godson comes all the way
from California.

245
00:21:43,145 --> 00:21:45,645
Give him a glass of wine.

246
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:06,867
I'll take care of it.

247
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:11,338
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

248
00:22:19,382 --> 00:22:21,882
How are you, Fredo?

249
00:22:22,518 --> 00:22:25,018
My brother Fredo.
This is Kay Adams.

250
00:22:26,122 --> 00:22:28,622
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

251
00:22:30,393 --> 00:22:33,590
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

252
00:22:33,696 --> 00:22:36,196
Yeah. This is your friend, huh?

253
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:41,597
I don't know what to do.
My voice is, is weak.

254
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:44,016
It's weak.

255
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,668
Anyway, if I had this part
in the picture, you know...

256
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:49,404
it puts me right back
up on top again.

257
00:22:50,513 --> 00:22:53,013
But this, uh...

258
00:22:53,182 --> 00:22:55,260
this man out there,
he won't give it to me.

259
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:57,329
- The head of the studio.
- What's his name?

260
00:22:57,353 --> 00:22:59,947
Woltz. Woltz.
He won't give it to me...

261
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:03,617
and he says
there's no chance, no chance.

262
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,130
Sonny?

263
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:11,831
Sonny?

264
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:19,373
Sonny?

265
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,102
Sonny, you in there?

266
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:24,844
- What?
- The old man wants to see you.

267
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:28,815
All right, one minute.

268
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:45,557
A month ago, he bought
the movie rights to this book.

269
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:47,479
A best-seller.

270
00:23:47,503 --> 00:23:49,781
And the main character
is a guy just like me.

271
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,305
Why, I wouldn't even
have to act.

272
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:53,785
Just be myself.

273
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,677
Oh, Godfather, I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

274
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:02,017
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

275
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:04,830
Is this how you turned out?

276
00:24:04,854 --> 00:24:07,482
A Hollywood finocchio
that cries like a woman?

277
00:24:09,158 --> 00:24:11,470
"What can I do?"
"What can I do?"

278
00:24:11,494 --> 00:24:13,038
What is that nonsense?

279
00:24:13,062 --> 00:24:15,562
Ridiculous!

280
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:22,834
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

281
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:24,483
Good.

282
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:26,747
Because the man who doesn't
spend time with his family...

283
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:28,920
can never be a real man.

284
00:24:28,944 --> 00:24:31,444
Come here.

285
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:37,417
You look terrible.
I want you to eat.

286
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:40,632
I want you to rest well,
and a month from now...

287
00:24:40,656 --> 00:24:43,784
this Hollywood big shot's
gonna give you what you want.

288
00:24:43,893 --> 00:24:46,393
Too late.
They start shooting in a week.

289
00:24:47,163 --> 00:24:49,663
I'm gonna make him an offer
he can't refuse.

290
00:24:53,102 --> 00:24:55,147
Now just go outside,
enjoy yourself and...

291
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:57,765
forget about all this nonsense.

292
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:01,869
Listen. I want you
to leave it all to me.

293
00:25:02,812 --> 00:25:05,312
All right.

294
00:25:28,537 --> 00:25:31,301
What time does my daughter
leave with the bridegroom?

295
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:33,885
In a few minutes,
right after they cut the cake.

296
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:37,106
Now, your new son-in-law,
we give him something important.

297
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:39,558
Never. Give him a living...

298
00:25:39,582 --> 00:25:42,608
but never discuss
the family business with him.

299
00:25:42,718 --> 00:25:44,095
What else?

300
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,697
Virgil Sollozzo called.

301
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:48,099
We have to give him a day
sometime next week.

302
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:50,623
We'll discuss him when you
come back from California.

303
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,971
When am I going to California?

304
00:25:52,995 --> 00:25:55,073
I want you to go tonight.

305
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:57,895
I want you to talk
to this movie big shot...

306
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,500
and settle this business
for Johnny.

307
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:04,438
Now if there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

308
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,310
Carlo, we're gonna take
the picture.

309
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:13,758
Wait a minute.

310
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,282
No, Michael, not me.

311
00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:20,499
Just a little closer.

312
00:26:20,523 --> 00:26:23,023
Okay, that's it.
Just like that now. Hold it.

313
00:28:07,863 --> 00:28:10,363
Isn't that nice?

314
00:28:15,337 --> 00:28:17,048
All right, start talking.

315
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:19,572
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

316
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:23,038
This friend is my client and would
give his undying friendship...

317
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:26,876
to Mr. Woltz, if Mr. Woltz
would grant us a small favor.

318
00:28:26,982 --> 00:28:29,461
Woltz is listening.

319
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:32,579
Give Johnny the part in that new
war film you're starting next week.

320
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:42,253
And what favor
would your friend...

321
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:44,242
grant Mr. Woltz?

322
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,144
You're gonna have
some union problems.

323
00:28:46,168 --> 00:28:47,979
My client could make them disappear.

324
00:28:48,003 --> 00:28:50,115
Also, one of your top stars
has just moved...

325
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:52,117
from marijuana to heroin.

326
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:54,119
- Are you trying to muscle me?
- Absolutely not.

327
00:28:54,143 --> 00:28:56,521
Now listen to me,
you smooth-talking son of a bitch!

328
00:28:56,545 --> 00:28:59,207
Let me lay it on the line for you
and your boss, whoever he is!

329
00:28:59,314 --> 00:29:00,925
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie.

330
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,428
I don't care
how many dago, guinea, wop...

331
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:05,797
greaseball goombahs
come outta the woodwork.

332
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:07,065
I'm German-Irish.

333
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:09,683
Well, let me tell you something,
my kraut mick friend.

334
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:12,693
I'm going to make so much trouble for you,
you won't know what hit you.

335
00:29:12,795 --> 00:29:14,773
Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer.
I have not threatened...

336
00:29:14,797 --> 00:29:17,698
I know almost every big lawyer
in New York. Who the hell are you?

337
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,031
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

338
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:23,636
Now, you have my number.
I'll wait for your call.

339
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,540
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.

340
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,981
Check him out.

341
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:59,305
- This is really beautiful.
- Look at this.

342
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:01,586
It used to decorate
the palace of a king.

343
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,888
Oh, yeah. Very nice.

344
00:30:03,912 --> 00:30:06,540
Why didn't you say
you worked for Corleone, Tom?

345
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:08,893
I thought you were just
some cheap, two-bit hustler...

346
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,962
Johnny was running in,
trying to bluff me.

347
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:13,465
I don't like to use his name
unless it's really necessary.

348
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:15,066
- How's your drink, Tom?
- Fine.

349
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:18,170
Hey, come on over here with me. I want to
show you something really beautiful.

350
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:20,694
You do appreciate beauty,
don't you, Tom?

351
00:30:23,465 --> 00:30:26,491
There you are.
$600,000 on four hooves.

352
00:30:26,602 --> 00:30:27,912
I'll bet Russian czars...

353
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:30,248
never paid that kind of dough
for a single horse.

354
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:32,772
Khartoum.

355
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:39,603
I'm not gonna race him, though.
I'm gonna put him out to stud.

356
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:41,259
Beautiful.

357
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:42,927
- Thanks, Tony.
- You're welcome.

358
00:30:42,951 --> 00:30:45,451
- Come on.
- Let's get something to eat.

359
00:30:46,922 --> 00:30:49,422
Mr. Corleone
is Johnny's godfather.

360
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,737
To the Italian people,
that's a very religious...

361
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:54,739
sacred, close relationship.

362
00:30:54,763 --> 00:30:55,874
I respect that.

363
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:58,398
Just tell him he should ask me
anything else.

364
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,000
But this is one favor
I can't give him.

365
00:31:01,303 --> 00:31:03,803
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

366
00:31:03,872 --> 00:31:06,864
- Understood?
- You don't understand.

367
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:09,475
Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

368
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:14,576
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

369
00:31:14,683 --> 00:31:16,661
I'm gonna run him
out of the business.

370
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:19,185
And let me tell you why.

371
00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:23,551
Johnny Fontane ruined
one of Woltz International's...

372
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:25,637
most valuable protégés.

373
00:31:25,661 --> 00:31:27,972
For five years,
we had her under training.

374
00:31:27,996 --> 00:31:31,056
Singing lessons,
acting lessons, dancing lessons.

375
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:33,545
I spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars on her.

376
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:35,847
I was gonna make her a big star.

377
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:38,601
And let me be even more frank.

378
00:31:38,707 --> 00:31:41,085
Just to show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man...

379
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,634
that it's not all dollars and cents.

380
00:31:43,745 --> 00:31:45,545
She was beautiful!

381
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:47,758
She was young, she was innocent!

382
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:49,761
She was the greatest piece of ass
I've ever had...

383
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:52,285
and I've had 'em all over the world!

384
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:55,133
And then Johnny Fontane comes along...

385
00:31:55,157 --> 00:31:58,058
with his olive oil voice and guinea charm.

386
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:01,861
And she runs off.

387
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:05,223
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous...

388
00:32:06,435 --> 00:32:08,847
and a man in my position can't afford...

389
00:32:08,871 --> 00:32:11,635
to be made to look ridiculous!

390
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,118
Now you get the hell outta here!

391
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,254
And if that goombah
tries any rough stuff...

392
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:18,778
you tell him I ain't no bandleader.

393
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:22,676
Yeah. I heard that story.

394
00:32:23,785 --> 00:32:26,285
Thank you for the dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

395
00:32:27,723 --> 00:32:30,317
If your car could take me
to the airport...

396
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:34,225
Mr. Corleone is a man who insists
on hearing bad news immediately.

397
00:34:27,175 --> 00:34:30,872
- You're not too tired are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

398
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:33,479
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

399
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:36,616
Now...

400
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:39,919
Sollozzo is known as "The Turk."

401
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,934
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife...

402
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,736
<i>but only
in matters of business...</i>

403
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,260
<i>with some sort
of reasonable complaint.</i>

404
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,590
<i>His business is narcotics.</i>

405
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:54,032
<i>He has fields in Turkey
where they grow the poppy...</i>

406
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:57,037
<i>and in Sicily he has the plants
to process them into heroin.</i>

407
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:01,707
<i>Now, he needs cash and he needs
protection from the police...</i>

408
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,888
<i>for which he gives
a piece of the action.</i>

409
00:35:03,912 --> 00:35:05,890
<i>I couldn't find out how much.</i>

410
00:35:05,914 --> 00:35:08,712
<i>The Tattaglia family
is behind him here in New York.</i>

411
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:10,962
<i>Now, they have to be
in it for something.</i>

412
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,096
Santino Corleone.

413
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,965
What about his prison record?

414
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,489
Two terms,
one in Italy, one here.

415
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:19,537
He's known as
a top narcotics man.

416
00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:22,061
Santino, what do you think?

417
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:25,665
There's a lot of money
in that white powder.

418
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:28,279
Tom?

419
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:30,803
<i>Well, I say, yes, there's more
money potential in narcotics...</i>

420
00:35:30,872 --> 00:35:32,850
<i>than anything else
we're looking at.</i>

421
00:35:32,874 --> 00:35:35,286
<i>Now, if we don't get into it,
somebody else will.</i>

422
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,422
<i>Maybe one of the five families,
maybe all of them.</i>

423
00:35:37,446 --> 00:35:38,726
<i>Now, with the money they earn...</i>

424
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,980
they can buy more police
and political power.

425
00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:44,262
Then they come after us.

426
00:35:44,286 --> 00:35:47,050
Now we have the unions,
we have the gambling...

427
00:35:47,155 --> 00:35:49,434
and they're the best things
to have, but narcotics...

428
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:50,935
is a thing of the future.

429
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,770
Now, if we don't get
a piece of that action...

430
00:35:52,794 --> 00:35:54,272
we risk everything we have.

431
00:35:54,296 --> 00:35:56,796
I mean, not now,
but ten years from now.

432
00:36:00,335 --> 00:36:03,429
So? What's your answer
gonna be, Pop?

433
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,680
I need a man
who has powerful friends.

434
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:18,280
I need a million dollars in cash.

435
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:20,465
I need, Don Corleone,
those politicians...

436
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:24,152
that you carry in your pocket
like so many nickels and dimes.

437
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:27,839
What is the interest
for my family?

438
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:29,774
Thirty percent.

439
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:32,596
In the first year, your end
should be three, four million dollars.

440
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:36,402
And then it would go up.

441
00:36:37,005 --> 00:36:39,505
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

442
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:45,011
My compliments.

443
00:36:47,816 --> 00:36:50,444
I'll take care of the Tattaglias.
Outta my share.

444
00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:54,149
So, I receive 30% for finance...

445
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,735
political influence
and legal protection.

446
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:00,259
- That's what you're telling me.
- That's right.

447
00:37:02,164 --> 00:37:06,066
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

448
00:37:06,168 --> 00:37:09,103
If you consider
a million dollars in cash...

449
00:37:09,204 --> 00:37:11,381
just "finance"...

450
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:13,405
<i>I salute you, Don Corleone.</i>

451
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:27,187
I said that I would see you because...

452
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:29,467
I heard that you were
a serious man...

453
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:31,991
to be treated with respect.

454
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,828
But I must say no to you.

455
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:43,447
And I'll give you my reason.

456
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:46,269
It's true, I have
a lot of friends in politics.

457
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:49,921
But they wouldn't be friendly
very long...

458
00:37:49,945 --> 00:37:52,290
if they knew my business was drugs
instead of gambling...

459
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:55,511
which they regard
as a harmless vice.

460
00:37:55,617 --> 00:37:58,245
- But drugs is a dirty business.
- No, Don Corleone...

461
00:37:58,353 --> 00:38:00,331
It doesn't make
any difference to me...

462
00:38:00,355 --> 00:38:03,119
what a man does for a living,
you understand...

463
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:05,725
but your business is...

464
00:38:06,795 --> 00:38:08,506
a little dangerous.

465
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,008
If you're worried about security
for your million...

466
00:38:11,032 --> 00:38:12,710
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

467
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:15,464
You're tellin' me the Tattaglias
guarantee our investment...

468
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,070
Wait a minute.

469
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:26,123
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children...

470
00:38:26,147 --> 00:38:28,459
and I spoil them,
as you can see.

471
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:30,161
They talk when they should listen.

472
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:32,296
But anyway...

473
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,820
Signor Sollozzo,
my no is final...

474
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:37,687
and I wish to congratulate you
on your new business.

475
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:41,057
I know you'll do very well,
and good luck to you...

476
00:38:41,162 --> 00:38:44,131
especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine.

477
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:48,067
Thank you.

478
00:39:08,523 --> 00:39:11,023
Come here.

479
00:39:12,794 --> 00:39:14,605
What's the matter with you?

480
00:39:14,629 --> 00:39:16,407
I think your brain
is going soft...

481
00:39:16,431 --> 00:39:19,298
from all that comedy you're
playing with that young girl.

482
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:22,802
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

483
00:39:24,973 --> 00:39:27,473
Go on.

484
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:32,941
Tom, what?
What is this nonsense?

485
00:39:33,048 --> 00:39:35,548
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

486
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:40,064
Well, take it away.

487
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:42,588
Take it over there.

488
00:39:42,857 --> 00:39:45,303
And...

489
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:47,827
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

490
00:39:53,668 --> 00:39:56,831
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

491
00:39:56,938 --> 00:40:00,305
I want you to find out what he's got
under his fingernails, you know?

492
00:40:01,142 --> 00:40:03,187
Go to the Tattaglias...

493
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:05,523
and make them think...

494
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:09,244
that you're not too happy
with our family...

495
00:40:10,352 --> 00:40:12,852
and find out what you can.

496
00:40:29,671 --> 00:40:33,630
And I got something
for your mother and for Sonny...

497
00:40:33,742 --> 00:40:35,786
and a tie for Freddy...

498
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,506
and Tom Hagen
got the Reynolds pen.

499
00:40:38,613 --> 00:40:40,691
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Me?

500
00:40:40,715 --> 00:40:43,215
Oh, just you.

501
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,528
Tell Paulie to get the car.
We're going.

502
00:41:17,552 --> 00:41:18,963
Okay, Pa.

503
00:41:18,987 --> 00:41:21,888
I'll have to get it myself, Pa.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

504
00:41:24,893 --> 00:41:27,393
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind gettin' the car.

505
00:42:16,444 --> 00:42:19,902
Luca, I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

506
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:21,459
I know.

507
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:23,983
Scotch? Prewar.

508
00:42:30,158 --> 00:42:31,658
You know who I am?

509
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,090
I know you.

510
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,970
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

511
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,970
I think you and I can do business.

512
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,480
I need someone strong like you.

513
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,940
I heard you are not happy...

514
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,650
...with the Corleone family.

515
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,150
Want to join me?

516
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,280
What's in it for me?

517
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,830
$50,000 to start with.

518
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,080
Not bad!

519
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,380
Agreed?

520
00:44:10,793 --> 00:44:12,770
Oh. Tom Hagen.

521
00:44:12,794 --> 00:44:14,572
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

522
00:44:14,596 --> 00:44:17,531
I'm glad I run into you.
I wanna talk to you.

523
00:44:17,632 --> 00:44:19,510
I haven't got time.

524
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:22,298
Oh, make time, consigliere.
Get in the car.

525
00:44:24,405 --> 00:44:25,983
What are you worried about?

526
00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:28,507
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

527
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,810
Get in.

528
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:43,791
<i>Wait a moment, Fredo.</i>

529
00:44:43,992 --> 00:44:46,492
- I'm gonna buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pa.

530
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:53,510
Hi. Merry Christmas.

531
00:44:53,534 --> 00:44:56,034
I want some fruit over there.

532
00:44:58,773 --> 00:45:01,273
Gimme three of them.

533
00:45:02,377 --> 00:45:04,877
No, that one.

534
00:45:22,997 --> 00:45:25,497
Fredo!

535
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:14,646
Papa.

536
00:46:14,682 --> 00:46:17,182
Papa!

537
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:24,787
Mike, would you like me better
if I were a nun...

538
00:46:24,892 --> 00:46:27,392
like in the story, you know?

539
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,631
No.

540
00:46:30,732 --> 00:46:33,633
Well, then would you like me better
if I were Ingrid Bergman?

541
00:46:33,735 --> 00:46:36,235
Now that's a thought.

542
00:46:37,606 --> 00:46:38,606
Michael.

543
00:46:39,307 --> 00:46:42,538
No, I would not like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

544
00:46:42,643 --> 00:46:45,143
- Michael.
- What's the matter?

545
00:47:00,928 --> 00:47:03,428
They don't say
if he's dead or alive.

546
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,525
Sonny, Michael.

547
00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:28,949
<i>Michael, where you been?</i>

548
00:47:29,056 --> 00:47:30,701
Is he all right?

549
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:33,455
<i>We don't know yet.
There's all kinds of stories.</i>

550
00:47:34,996 --> 00:47:37,496
<i>He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>

551
00:47:37,932 --> 00:47:41,060
<i>- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.</i>

552
00:47:41,169 --> 00:47:43,580
<i>Where you been? I was worried.</i>

553
00:47:43,604 --> 00:47:45,749
Didn't Tom tell you? I called.

554
00:47:45,773 --> 00:47:49,504
<i>No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>

555
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:52,110
All right.

556
00:47:57,819 --> 00:48:00,319
Oh, my God.

557
00:48:14,302 --> 00:48:16,802
Who is it?

558
00:48:16,904 --> 00:48:19,404
Open up. It's Clemenza.

559
00:48:20,408 --> 00:48:21,451
What?

560
00:48:21,475 --> 00:48:23,975
There's more news about your old man.

561
00:48:24,445 --> 00:48:26,490
The word is out on the street
he's already dead.

562
00:48:26,514 --> 00:48:28,492
Shut your mouth.
What's the matter with you?

563
00:48:28,516 --> 00:48:31,016
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

564
00:48:31,052 --> 00:48:33,230
- Where was Paulie?
- Paulie was out sick.

565
00:48:33,254 --> 00:48:35,774
- He's been home sick all winter.
- How many times he been sick?

566
00:48:35,823 --> 00:48:37,367
Only maybe three, four times.

567
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:39,631
I mean, I asked Freddy if he wants
a different bodyguard.

568
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:41,171
- He said no.
- Pick him up right now.

569
00:48:41,195 --> 00:48:43,006
I don't care how sick he is.

570
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,776
If he's breathin', I want you to bring him
to my father's house now. You understand? Now

571
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,598
- You want me to send people here?
- No, just you and him. Go ahead.

572
00:48:48,703 --> 00:48:51,203
All right.

573
00:48:58,212 --> 00:49:01,413
I'm havin' a couple of our people come
over to the house. A couple of our people.

574
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:07,264
<i>- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?</i>

575
00:49:07,288 --> 00:49:09,788
<i>- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.</i>

576
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:13,894
<i>In about three hours, he'll be
released with our proposition.</i>

577
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:17,362
<i>Listen to everything he has
to say before you do anything.</i>

578
00:49:17,465 --> 00:49:19,076
<i>What's done is done.</i>

579
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,069
<i>And don't lose that famous temper
of yours, huh, Sonny?</i>

580
00:49:22,169 --> 00:49:24,669
No, I'll wait.

581
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:40,685
Your boss is dead.

582
00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:45,469
I know you're not in the muscle
end of the family, Tom...

583
00:49:45,493 --> 00:49:47,993
so I don't want you to be scared.

584
00:49:48,562 --> 00:49:51,087
I want you
to help the Corleones...

585
00:49:51,198 --> 00:49:53,698
and I want you to help me.

586
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:58,081
Yeah. We got him outside his office...

587
00:49:58,105 --> 00:50:00,605
just about an hour after we picked you up.

588
00:50:02,443 --> 00:50:04,943
Drink it.

589
00:50:08,082 --> 00:50:11,518
So now it's up to you to make
the peace between me and Sonny.

590
00:50:16,057 --> 00:50:18,557
Sonny was hot
for my deal, wasn't he?

591
00:50:19,961 --> 00:50:22,461
And you knew it was
the right thing to do.

592
00:50:24,298 --> 00:50:26,798
Sonny will come after you
with everything he's got.

593
00:50:27,568 --> 00:50:30,068
That'll be his first reaction, sure.

594
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:33,216
That's why you gotta
talk some sense into him.

595
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,471
The Tattaglia family is behind me
with all their people.

596
00:50:37,445 --> 00:50:39,726
The other New York families
will go along with anything...

597
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,250
that will prevent a full-scale war.

598
00:50:42,683 --> 00:50:45,028
Let's face it, Tom,
in all due respect...

599
00:50:45,052 --> 00:50:47,612
the Don, rest in peace, was slippin'.

600
00:50:50,524 --> 00:50:53,024
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

601
00:50:57,498 --> 00:50:59,042
Well, now he's dead.

602
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:01,566
He's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

603
00:51:03,204 --> 00:51:05,315
So you gotta talk to Sonny.

604
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:07,250
You gotta talk
to the caporegimes...

605
00:51:07,274 --> 00:51:09,774
that Tessio, and that fat Clemenza.

606
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:16,681
It's good business, Tom.

607
00:51:17,618 --> 00:51:19,896
I'll try.

608
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,582
But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

609
00:51:25,593 --> 00:51:28,093
Yeah. Well...

610
00:51:28,896 --> 00:51:31,396
Let me worry about Luca.

611
00:51:36,804 --> 00:51:38,682
You just talk to Sonny.

612
00:51:38,706 --> 00:51:41,206
And the other two kids.

613
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:45,922
I'll do my best.

614
00:51:45,946 --> 00:51:48,446
Good.

615
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:51,750
Now, you can go.

616
00:51:58,626 --> 00:52:01,959
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

617
00:52:03,497 --> 00:52:05,997
Blood is a big expense.

618
00:52:27,088 --> 00:52:28,965
He's still alive.

619
00:52:28,989 --> 00:52:31,489
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

620
00:52:32,993 --> 00:52:34,971
Well, that's bad luck for me...

621
00:52:34,995 --> 00:52:37,495
and bad luck for you
if you don't make that deal.

622
00:53:22,476 --> 00:53:24,521
Your mother's over
in the hospital with your father.

623
00:53:24,545 --> 00:53:27,045
Looks like he's gonna
pull through, thank God.

624
00:53:29,116 --> 00:53:31,361
- That's a lot of bad blood.
- What do you think?

625
00:53:31,385 --> 00:53:34,252
It's too far.
I think it's too personal.

626
00:53:34,355 --> 00:53:37,017
- The Don will consider this over.
- You gonna kill all those guys?

627
00:53:37,124 --> 00:53:39,764
- Hey, stay out of it, Mickey, do me a favor.
- Sollozzo's the key.

628
00:53:39,788 --> 00:53:41,905
You get rid of him,
everything falls into line.

629
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:44,523
What about Luca? Sollozzo
didn't seem worried about Luca.

630
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:49,999
I don't know. If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

631
00:53:50,104 --> 00:53:52,149
Has anyone been able
to get in touch with Luca?

632
00:53:52,173 --> 00:53:54,251
We've been tryin' all night.
He might be shacked up.

633
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:55,318
Hey, Mick, try him again.

634
00:53:55,342 --> 00:53:56,987
Luca never sleeps over
with a broad.

635
00:53:57,011 --> 00:53:59,511
He always goes home
when he's through.

636
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:03,016
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.

637
00:54:03,117 --> 00:54:06,245
What do we do
if the old man dies, God forbid?

638
00:54:06,353 --> 00:54:08,853
If we lose the old man...

639
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:12,558
we lose our political contacts
and half our strength.

640
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,561
The other New York families might
wind up supporting Sollozzo...

641
00:54:15,663 --> 00:54:18,008
just to avoid a long destructive war.

642
00:54:18,032 --> 00:54:21,763
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

643
00:54:23,003 --> 00:54:25,503
If your father dies...

644
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,585
you'll make the deal, Sonny.

645
00:54:28,609 --> 00:54:31,169
You know, that's easy for you to say,
Tom. He's not your father.

646
00:54:31,278 --> 00:54:33,778
I was as much a son to him
as you or Mike.

647
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:40,697
What is it?

648
00:54:40,721 --> 00:54:43,166
Hey, Paulie, I thought
I told you to stay put.

649
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:45,818
Well, the guy at the gates,
they say they got a package.

650
00:54:45,926 --> 00:54:48,426
Yeah? Tessio, go see what it is.

651
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:53,777
- You want me to hang around?
- Yeah, hang around.

652
00:54:53,801 --> 00:54:55,278
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

653
00:54:55,302 --> 00:54:57,998
Yeah? There's some food
in the icebox. You hungry or anything?

654
00:54:58,105 --> 00:55:00,150
- No, it's all right. Thanks.
- How 'bout a drink? How 'bout a little brandy?

655
00:55:00,174 --> 00:55:02,094
- That's good to sweat it out.
- All right, sure.

656
00:55:02,118 --> 00:55:04,618
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

657
00:55:06,146 --> 00:55:08,646
I want you to take care
of that son of a bitch right away.

658
00:55:08,682 --> 00:55:11,207
Paulie sold out the old man, that strutz.

659
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:14,412
I don't wanna see him again. Make that
first thing on your list, understand?

660
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:15,832
Understood.

661
00:55:15,856 --> 00:55:18,168
Hey, Mickey, tomorrow.
You get a couple of guys.

662
00:55:18,192 --> 00:55:20,953
You go over to Luca's apartment. Hang
around. Wait for him to show up.

663
00:55:20,977 --> 00:55:24,455
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

664
00:55:24,565 --> 00:55:26,810
Yeah.

665
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:30,361
Listen, hang around the house
on the phone. It'll be a big help.

666
00:55:31,472 --> 00:55:33,972
Try Luca again. Go ahead.

667
00:55:42,316 --> 00:55:45,149
- What the hell is this?
- It's a Sicilian message.

668
00:55:45,252 --> 00:55:47,752
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

669
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:04,035
- I'm goin' now.
- What time you gonna be home tonight?

670
00:56:04,071 --> 00:56:06,571
I don't know. Probably late.

671
00:56:07,841 --> 00:56:11,368
- Don't forget the cannoli.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:56:14,081 --> 00:56:17,881
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rearview mirror.

673
00:56:20,054 --> 00:56:21,598
That Sonny's runnin' wild.

674
00:56:21,622 --> 00:56:23,667
He's thinkin' of goin'
to the mattresses already.

675
00:56:23,691 --> 00:56:26,251
We gotta find a spot
over on the West Side.

676
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,454
We'll try 309 West 43rd Street.

677
00:56:29,563 --> 00:56:31,908
You know any good spots
on the West Side?

678
00:56:31,932 --> 00:56:34,812
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- Well, think about it while you're drivin'.

679
00:56:34,836 --> 00:56:36,780
I wanna hit New York sometime this month.

680
00:56:36,804 --> 00:56:39,304
And watch out for the kids
when you're backin' out.

681
00:56:49,683 --> 00:56:52,095
Hey, Paulie, I want you to go
down 39th Street. Colosanto's.

682
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:55,179
You pick up 18 mattresses for the guys
to sleep, will you? Bring me the bill.

683
00:56:55,289 --> 00:56:58,190
- Yeah, all right.
- Make sure they're clean because...

684
00:56:58,292 --> 00:57:01,489
Those guys are gonna be stuck up in there for a long time, you know?

685
00:57:01,595 --> 00:57:03,773
They're clean. They told me
they exterminate them.

686
00:57:03,797 --> 00:57:05,875
"Exterminate"?
That's a bad word to use.

687
00:57:05,899 --> 00:57:08,868
Exterminate. Get this guy.
See how we don't exterminate you.

688
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:11,469
<i>- Youse funny, or what?
- Hey, Paulie. Did you fart?</i>

689
00:57:12,673 --> 00:57:15,173
- Yeah, Rocco, what'd you do?
- No, me. Nothin'. It wasn't me.

690
00:57:15,242 --> 00:57:17,287
- It's gotta be him.
- Hey, pull over, will you.

691
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,811
I gotta take a leak.

692
00:58:01,021 --> 00:58:02,799
Leave the gun.

693
00:58:02,823 --> 00:58:05,323
Take the cannoli.

694
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:23,612
<i>Hey, Mike?</i>

695
00:58:24,113 --> 00:58:25,613
<i>Hey, Mikey?</i>

696
00:58:27,114 --> 00:58:28,114
Yeah?

697
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:29,614
<i>You're wanted on the telephone.</i>

698
00:58:35,322 --> 00:58:37,822
- Who is it?
- It's some girl.

699
00:58:41,895 --> 00:58:43,072
Hello, Kay?

700
00:58:43,096 --> 00:58:44,441
<i>How's your father?</i>

701
00:58:44,465 --> 00:58:46,242
He's good. He's gonna make it.

702
00:58:46,266 --> 00:58:48,743
<i>I love you.</i>

703
00:58:48,767 --> 00:58:49,767
Huh?

704
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:52,070
<i>I love you!</i>

705
00:58:52,306 --> 00:58:53,807
<i>Michael?</i>

706
00:58:54,185 --> 00:58:55,185
Yeah, I know.

707
00:58:55,209 --> 00:58:56,986
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

708
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,687
Yeah, I can't talk.

709
00:58:58,711 --> 00:59:00,511
<i>Can't you say it?</i>

710
00:59:01,315 --> 00:59:03,815
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

711
00:59:04,017 --> 00:59:07,009
Hey, Mikey. Why don't you tell
that nice girl you love her?

712
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,165
I love you with all o' my heart!

713
00:59:09,189 --> 00:59:11,714
If I don't see you again a-soon,
I'm-a gonna die!

714
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,938
Come over here, kid.
Learn somethin'.

715
00:59:14,962 --> 00:59:17,462
You never know. You might have to cook
for 20 guys someday.

716
00:59:17,965 --> 00:59:20,276
You see? You start out
with a little bit of oil.

717
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,845
Then you fry some garlic.

718
00:59:21,869 --> 00:59:24,497
Then you throw in some tomatoes,
some tomato paste.

719
00:59:24,605 --> 00:59:27,267
You fry it.
You make sure it doesn't stick.

720
00:59:27,374 --> 00:59:30,537
When you got it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and your meatballs.

721
00:59:33,413 --> 00:59:35,913
Add a little bit of wine.

722
00:59:38,752 --> 00:59:41,653
And a little bit of sugar.

723
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,400
- And that's my trick.
- Why don't you cut the crap?

724
00:59:44,424 --> 00:59:46,569
I got more important things
for you to do.

725
00:59:46,593 --> 00:59:49,187
- How's Paulie?
- Oh, Paulie. Won't see him no more.

726
00:59:51,265 --> 00:59:53,743
- Where you going?
- To the city.

727
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:55,411
Send some bodyguards with him.

728
00:59:55,435 --> 00:59:57,413
- No. I'm just going to the hospital to see Pop.
- Nevermind. Send somebody with him.

729
00:59:57,437 --> 01:00:00,338
Oh, he'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

730
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,940
- All right. Be careful, huh?
- Yes, sir.

731
01:00:05,946 --> 01:00:08,446
Send somebody with him anyway.

732
01:00:36,643 --> 01:00:38,454
I have to go.

733
01:00:38,478 --> 01:00:40,978
Can I go with you?

734
01:00:41,315 --> 01:00:43,875
No, Kay. There's gonna be
detectives there.

735
01:00:43,984 --> 01:00:45,962
People from the press.

736
01:00:45,986 --> 01:00:48,486
Well, I'll ride in a cab.

737
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:52,990
I don't want you to get involved.

738
01:00:55,662 --> 01:00:58,162
When will I see you again?

739
01:01:04,338 --> 01:01:06,316
Go back to New Hampshire...

740
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:08,840
and I'll call you
at your parents' house.

741
01:01:10,177 --> 01:01:12,677
When will I see you again,
Michael?

742
01:01:14,181 --> 01:01:16,681
I don't know.

743
01:03:26,713 --> 01:03:28,825
What are you doing here?

744
01:03:28,849 --> 01:03:30,927
You're not supposed
to be here now.

745
01:03:30,951 --> 01:03:34,512
I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.

746
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:37,181
There's nobody here.
What happened to the guards?

747
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,602
Your father just had
too many visitors.

748
01:03:39,626 --> 01:03:42,527
They interfered
with hospital service.

749
01:03:42,629 --> 01:03:45,530
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

750
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:54,372
Get me Long Beach 4-5-6-2-0, please.

751
01:03:56,977 --> 01:03:59,477
Nurse, wait a minute. Stay here.

752
01:04:03,316 --> 01:04:05,628
Sonny, Michael.
I'm at the hospital.

753
01:04:05,652 --> 01:04:08,212
Listen. I got here late.
There's nobody here.

754
01:04:08,321 --> 01:04:11,313
Nobody. No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody.

755
01:04:11,424 --> 01:04:14,222
<i>- Pop is all alone.
- Don't panic. We'll send somebody.</i>

756
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:16,639
I won't panic.

757
01:04:16,663 --> 01:04:19,223
I'm sorry, but you will
have to leave.

758
01:04:22,169 --> 01:04:24,899
You and I are gonna move my father
to another room.

759
01:04:25,005 --> 01:04:28,065
Now, can you disconnect those tubes
so we can move the bed out?

760
01:04:28,175 --> 01:04:31,667
- That's out of the question.
- Do you know my father?

761
01:04:31,778 --> 01:04:33,956
Men are coming here to kill him.

762
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:36,092
You understand?

763
01:04:36,116 --> 01:04:38,616
Now, help me, please.

764
01:05:54,961 --> 01:05:59,694
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo... the baker.

765
01:05:59,799 --> 01:06:01,277
- You remember me?
- Enzo?

766
01:06:01,301 --> 01:06:03,181
- Yes, Enzo.
- You better get out of here, Enzo.

767
01:06:03,205 --> 01:06:05,114
There's gonna be trouble.

768
01:06:05,138 --> 01:06:07,617
If there is trouble,
I stay here to help you...

769
01:06:07,641 --> 01:06:10,141
For your father. For your father.

770
01:06:11,144 --> 01:06:12,955
All right, listen.

771
01:06:12,979 --> 01:06:15,124
Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital.

772
01:06:15,148 --> 01:06:18,151
All right? I'll be out
in a minute. Go ahead.

773
01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:19,575
Okay, okay.

774
01:06:32,098 --> 01:06:36,398
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

775
01:06:37,604 --> 01:06:40,104
I'm with you now.

776
01:06:41,274 --> 01:06:43,774
I'm with you.

777
01:07:18,311 --> 01:07:20,811
Get rid of these. Come here.

778
01:07:21,147 --> 01:07:23,647
Put your hand in your pocket
like you have a gun.

779
01:07:24,317 --> 01:07:26,817
You'll be all right.

780
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:33,591
You'll be okay.

781
01:08:17,303 --> 01:08:19,803
You did good.

782
01:08:52,939 --> 01:08:55,084
Here he is.

783
01:08:55,108 --> 01:08:57,608
All right, hold still.

784
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,465
I thought I got
all you guinea hoods locked up.

785
01:09:09,489 --> 01:09:10,933
What the hell are you doing here?

786
01:09:10,957 --> 01:09:13,457
What happened to the men who
were guarding my father, Captain?

787
01:09:13,793 --> 01:09:15,438
Why, you little punk.

788
01:09:15,462 --> 01:09:17,502
What the hell are you doing,
telling me my business?

789
01:09:17,526 --> 01:09:19,341
I pulled them guys off of here.

790
01:09:19,365 --> 01:09:22,357
Now, you get out of here
and stay away from this hospital.

791
01:09:22,469 --> 01:09:25,438
I'm not moving until you put
some guards around my father's room.

792
01:09:26,139 --> 01:09:28,117
Phil, take him in.

793
01:09:28,141 --> 01:09:30,553
The kid's clean, Captain.
He's a war hero.

794
01:09:30,577 --> 01:09:33,478
- He's never been busted...
- Goddamn it, I said take him in.

795
01:09:35,582 --> 01:09:38,107
What's the Turk paying you
to set up my father, Captain?

796
01:09:39,419 --> 01:09:41,530
Take a hold of him.
Stand him up.

797
01:09:41,554 --> 01:09:44,054
Stand him up straight.

798
01:10:05,945 --> 01:10:07,990
I'm the attorney
for the Corleone family.

799
01:10:08,014 --> 01:10:10,744
These men are private detectives
hired to protect Vito Corleone.

800
01:10:11,618 --> 01:10:13,362
They're licensed to carry firearms.

801
01:10:13,386 --> 01:10:15,886
If you interfere, you'll have to
appear before a judge...

802
01:10:15,955 --> 01:10:18,515
in the morning and show cause.

803
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:21,125
All right, let him go.

804
01:10:21,194 --> 01:10:23,694
Come on.

805
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:55,137
What's with all the new faces?

806
01:10:55,161 --> 01:10:56,972
Gonna need 'em now.

807
01:10:56,996 --> 01:10:59,624
After the hospital thing,
Sonny got mad.

808
01:10:59,732 --> 01:11:02,860
We hit Bruno Tattaglia
at 4:00 this morning.

809
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:06,670
Jesus Christ.

810
01:11:13,012 --> 01:11:15,512
Looks like a fortress around here.

811
01:11:20,019 --> 01:11:22,920
A hundred button men on the street,
24 hours a day.

812
01:11:23,022 --> 01:11:26,253
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.

813
01:11:28,861 --> 01:11:31,361
Hey, Mike, come here.
Let me look at you.

814
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:36,478
You look beautiful.
Just beautiful.

815
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:37,980
You're gorgeous.

816
01:11:38,004 --> 01:11:40,700
Hey, listen to this.
The Turk, he wants to talk.

817
01:11:40,807 --> 01:11:43,537
Imagine the nerve
on this son of a bitch.

818
01:11:43,643 --> 01:11:45,955
Craps out last night,
he wants a meeting today.

819
01:11:45,979 --> 01:11:48,479
- What'd he say?
- What did he say?

820
01:11:49,148 --> 01:11:51,293
He wants us to send Michael
to hear the proposition.

821
01:11:51,317 --> 01:11:54,377
And the promise is that the deal
is so good that we can't refuse.

822
01:11:54,988 --> 01:11:56,632
What about Bruno Tattaglia?

823
01:11:56,656 --> 01:11:58,300
That's part of the deal.

824
01:11:58,324 --> 01:12:00,302
Bruno cancels out what they did
to my father.

825
01:12:00,326 --> 01:12:02,826
Sonny, we ought to hear
what they have to say.

826
01:12:03,163 --> 01:12:05,641
No. No. No. No more.
Not this time, Consigliere.

827
01:12:05,665 --> 01:12:09,226
No more meetings, no more discussions,
no more Sollozzo tricks.

828
01:12:09,335 --> 01:12:11,146
You give them one message...
I want Sollozzo.

829
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,815
If not, it's all-out war.
We go to the mattresses.

830
01:12:12,839 --> 01:12:14,919
Some of the other families
won't sit still for a war.

831
01:12:14,943 --> 01:12:17,423
- Then they hand me Sollozzo.
- Your father wouldn't hear this.

832
01:12:17,447 --> 01:12:19,736
- This is business, not personal.
- They shot my father.

833
01:12:19,846 --> 01:12:23,247
Even shooting your father
was business, not personal, Sonny.

834
01:12:23,349 --> 01:12:25,349
Well, then business will have to suffer.
All right?

835
01:12:25,373 --> 01:12:26,996
And do me a favor, Tom...

836
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:28,998
No more advice on how
to patch things up.

837
01:12:29,022 --> 01:12:31,522
Just help me win, please.
All right?

838
01:12:37,463 --> 01:12:40,023
I found out about this Captain McCluskey
who broke Mike's jaw.

839
01:12:40,133 --> 01:12:41,610
What about him?

840
01:12:41,634 --> 01:12:44,694
Now he's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

841
01:12:44,804 --> 01:12:47,705
McCluskey has agreed
to be the Turk's bodyguard.

842
01:12:47,807 --> 01:12:49,785
What you have to understand,
Sonny...

843
01:12:49,809 --> 01:12:51,954
is that while Sollozzo's
being guarded like this...

844
01:12:51,978 --> 01:12:53,789
he is invulnerable.

845
01:12:53,813 --> 01:12:57,374
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain. Never.

846
01:12:57,483 --> 01:13:00,543
It would be disastrous. All the
five families would come after you, Sonny.

847
01:13:00,653 --> 01:13:03,383
The Corleone family
would be outcast.

848
01:13:03,489 --> 01:13:07,186
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

849
01:13:08,661 --> 01:13:10,806
So do me a favor.

850
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:13,458
Take this into consideration.

851
01:13:16,269 --> 01:13:18,769
All right, we'll wait.

852
01:13:23,509 --> 01:13:25,988
We can't wait.

853
01:13:26,012 --> 01:13:27,990
Can't wait.

854
01:13:28,014 --> 01:13:29,774
I don't care what Sollozzo says
about a deal.

855
01:13:29,798 --> 01:13:31,927
He's gonna kill Pop. That's it.

856
01:13:31,951 --> 01:13:33,762
That's the key for him.

857
01:13:33,786 --> 01:13:35,764
Got to get Sollozzo.

858
01:13:35,788 --> 01:13:37,933
CLEMENZA: Mike is right.

859
01:13:37,957 --> 01:13:39,935
Let me ask you something first.

860
01:13:39,959 --> 01:13:43,019
What about this McCluskey?

861
01:13:43,129 --> 01:13:45,629
What do we do with this cop here?

862
01:13:49,969 --> 01:13:52,469
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

863
01:13:53,973 --> 01:13:56,533
It will be me...

864
01:13:56,642 --> 01:13:59,142
McCluskey and Sollozzo.

865
01:14:00,146 --> 01:14:02,646
Let's set the meeting.

866
01:14:04,317 --> 01:14:07,718
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

867
01:14:09,822 --> 01:14:13,553
Now we insist it's a public place...
a bar, a restaurant.

868
01:14:13,659 --> 01:14:17,390
Some place where there's people,
so I feel safe.

869
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:23,234
They're gonna search me
when I first meet them, right?

870
01:14:23,336 --> 01:14:25,836
So I can't have a weapon on me then.

871
01:14:29,008 --> 01:14:31,508
But if Clemenza can figure a way...

872
01:14:31,611 --> 01:14:34,111
to have a weapon
planted there for me...

873
01:14:38,951 --> 01:14:41,451
then I'll kill them both.

874
01:14:53,332 --> 01:14:55,857
What are you gonna do?
Nice college boy, huh?

875
01:14:55,946 --> 01:14:57,946
Didn't want to get mixed up
in the family business.

876
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:59,948
Now you want to gun down
a police captain?

877
01:14:59,972 --> 01:15:01,989
Why? 'Cause he slapped you
in the face a little bit?

878
01:15:02,013 --> 01:15:04,325
What do you think this is, the army,
where you shoot them a mile away?

879
01:15:04,349 --> 01:15:05,954
You gotta get up close,
like this and...

880
01:15:05,978 --> 01:15:09,379
You blow their brains all over your
nice Ivy League suit. Come here.

881
01:15:09,482 --> 01:15:11,794
You're taking this very personal.

882
01:15:11,818 --> 01:15:15,049
Tom, this is business, and this man
is taking it very, very personal.

883
01:15:15,154 --> 01:15:17,166
Where does it say that
you can't kill a cop?

884
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:19,715
- Come on, Mikey.
- Tom, wait a minute.

885
01:15:19,826 --> 01:15:22,556
I'm talking about a cop
that's mixed up in drugs.

886
01:15:22,662 --> 01:15:26,792
I'm talking about a dishonest cop,
a crooked cop...

887
01:15:26,899 --> 01:15:29,766
who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming to him.

888
01:15:29,869 --> 01:15:31,914
That's a terrific story.

889
01:15:31,938 --> 01:15:34,668
Now we have newspaper people
on the payroll, don't we, Tom?

890
01:15:36,209 --> 01:15:38,420
They might like a story like that.

891
01:15:38,444 --> 01:15:40,944
They might. They just might.

892
01:15:43,783 --> 01:15:45,928
It's not personal, Sonny.

893
01:15:45,952 --> 01:15:48,452
It's strictly business.

894
01:15:50,456 --> 01:15:52,100
It's as cold as they come.

895
01:15:52,124 --> 01:15:55,685
Impossible to trace, so you don't
worry about prints, Mike.

896
01:15:55,795 --> 01:15:58,696
I put a special tape
on the trigger and the butt.

897
01:15:58,798 --> 01:16:01,298
Here. Try it.

898
01:16:11,978 --> 01:16:14,478
What's the matter,
the trigger too tight?

899
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,795
- My ears.
- I left it noisy.

900
01:16:19,819 --> 01:16:24,552
That way it scares pain-in-the-ass
innocent bystanders away.

901
01:16:24,657 --> 01:16:27,157
All right, you shot them both.
Now what do you do?

902
01:16:29,762 --> 01:16:31,907
Sit down, finish my dinner.

903
01:16:31,931 --> 01:16:33,575
Come on, kid. Don't fool around.

904
01:16:33,599 --> 01:16:37,160
Just let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

905
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:39,414
Everybody will still think
you got it.

906
01:16:39,438 --> 01:16:41,583
They're gonna be staring
at your face, Mike...

907
01:16:41,607 --> 01:16:44,667
so walk out of the place real fast,
but you don't run.

908
01:16:44,777 --> 01:16:48,178
Don't look nobody directly in the
eye, but you don't look away, either.

909
01:16:48,281 --> 01:16:50,481
Hey, they're gonna be scared stiff
of you, believe me...

910
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,005
so don't worry about nothing.

911
01:16:53,953 --> 01:16:55,764
You know, you're gonna turn out all right.

912
01:16:55,788 --> 01:16:58,100
You take a long vacation,
nobody knows where...

913
01:16:58,124 --> 01:17:00,602
and we're gonna catch the hell.

914
01:17:00,626 --> 01:17:02,771
How bad do you think
it's gonna be?

915
01:17:02,795 --> 01:17:04,773
Pretty goddamn bad.

916
01:17:04,797 --> 01:17:07,857
Probably all the other families
will line up against us.

917
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,868
That's all right. These things
gotta happen every five years or so.

918
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:13,530
Ten years.
Helps to get rid of the bad blood.

919
01:17:13,639 --> 01:17:16,199
Been ten years since
the last one.

920
01:17:16,309 --> 01:17:18,287
You know, you gotta stop them
at the beginning...

921
01:17:18,311 --> 01:17:20,455
like they should have
stopped Hitler at Munich.

922
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:22,457
They should have never let him
get away with that.

923
01:17:22,481 --> 01:17:24,981
They was just asking
for big trouble.

924
01:17:25,318 --> 01:17:27,878
You know, Mike,
we was all proud of you...

925
01:17:27,987 --> 01:17:29,731
being a hero and all.

926
01:17:29,755 --> 01:17:32,255
Your father too.

927
01:18:09,629 --> 01:18:11,440
Nothing. Not a hint.

928
01:18:11,464 --> 01:18:13,964
Absolutely nothing.

929
01:18:14,133 --> 01:18:17,034
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting's going to be held.

930
01:18:18,304 --> 01:18:20,804
How much time do we have?

931
01:18:21,641 --> 01:18:23,721
Gonna pick you up in front
of Jack Dempsey's joint...

932
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:26,245
in an hour and a half...
exactly an hour and a half.

933
01:18:27,647 --> 01:18:30,147
We could put a tail on them,
see how it turns out.

934
01:18:30,249 --> 01:18:33,480
Sollozzo'll lose our ass
going around the block.

935
01:18:33,586 --> 01:18:35,097
What about the negotiator?

936
01:18:35,121 --> 01:18:37,817
He's over at my place playing
pinochle with a couple of my men.

937
01:18:37,923 --> 01:18:39,701
He's happy.
They're letting him win.

938
01:18:39,725 --> 01:18:43,354
It's too much of a risk for Mike.
Maybe we ought to call it off, Sonny.

939
01:18:43,462 --> 01:18:47,023
The negotiator keeps on playing cards
until Mike comes back safe and sound.

940
01:18:47,091 --> 01:18:49,411
So why don't they just blast who's ever
in the goddamn car?

941
01:18:49,435 --> 01:18:51,413
Too dangerous.
They'll be looking for that.

942
01:18:51,437 --> 01:18:53,937
Sollozzo might not
even be in the car, Sonny.

943
01:18:54,607 --> 01:18:57,107
I get it.

944
01:19:06,452 --> 01:19:08,952
Yeah.

945
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:24,701
- Louis Restaurant in the Bronx.
- Well is it reliable?

946
01:19:24,804 --> 01:19:26,615
That's my man in McCluskey's precinct.

947
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:29,472
A police captain's got to be
on call 24 hours a day.

948
01:19:29,575 --> 01:19:32,476
He signed out at that number
between 8:00 and 10:00.

949
01:19:32,578 --> 01:19:34,122
Anybody know this joint?

950
01:19:34,146 --> 01:19:37,547
Yeah, sure. I do.
It's perfect for us.

951
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:39,895
A small family place, good food.

952
01:19:39,919 --> 01:19:42,752
Everyone minds his business.
It's perfect.

953
01:19:42,855 --> 01:19:45,653
Pete, they got
an old-fashioned toilet...

954
01:19:45,758 --> 01:19:48,989
You know, the box
and the chain thing.

955
01:19:50,596 --> 01:19:53,156
We might be able
to tape the gun behind it.

956
01:19:53,265 --> 01:19:54,743
All right.

957
01:19:54,767 --> 01:19:57,930
Mike, you go to the restaurant.

958
01:19:58,037 --> 01:20:00,415
You eat, you talk for a while,
you relax.

959
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:02,117
You make them relax.

960
01:20:02,141 --> 01:20:04,486
Then you get up
and go take a leak.

961
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:07,172
No, better still,
you ask for permission to go.

962
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:09,124
And when you come back,
you come out blasting.

963
01:20:09,148 --> 01:20:12,083
And don't take any chances.
Two shots in the head apiece.

964
01:20:12,184 --> 01:20:14,262
Now, listen.
I want somebody good...

965
01:20:14,286 --> 01:20:16,264
and I mean very good...
to plant that gun.

966
01:20:16,288 --> 01:20:19,968
I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet
with just his dick in his hands, all right?

967
01:20:19,992 --> 01:20:21,103
The gun will be there.

968
01:20:21,127 --> 01:20:25,359
All right, listen. You drive him
and you pick him up after the job.

969
01:20:25,464 --> 01:20:27,964
Come on. Let's move.

970
01:20:28,033 --> 01:20:30,533
Thank you, Tom.

971
01:20:32,805 --> 01:20:35,706
Did he tell you
to drop the gun right away?

972
01:20:35,808 --> 01:20:38,308
Yeah, a million times.

973
01:20:42,481 --> 01:20:44,960
Now, you don't forget...
two shots apiece in the head...

974
01:20:44,984 --> 01:20:47,129
as soon as you
come out the door.

975
01:20:47,153 --> 01:20:49,653
Let's go.

976
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:55,889
How long do you think it'll be
before I can come back?

977
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:59,975
At least a year, Mike.

978
01:20:59,999 --> 01:21:03,560
Listen, I'll square it with Mom, you know,
you not seeing her before you leave...

979
01:21:03,669 --> 01:21:08,072
and I'll get a message
to that girlfriend...

980
01:21:08,174 --> 01:21:10,674
when I think the time is right.

981
01:21:15,848 --> 01:21:18,348
Take care.

982
01:21:20,519 --> 01:21:23,019
- See you, Mike.
- Okay, Tom.

983
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:56,798
I'm glad you came, Mike.

984
01:21:56,822 --> 01:21:59,322
I hope we can
straighten everything out.

985
01:21:59,992 --> 01:22:02,859
I mean, this is terrible. It's not the way
I wanted things to go at all.

986
01:22:02,962 --> 01:22:04,806
It should have never happened.

987
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:06,975
I want to straighten
everything out tonight.

988
01:22:06,999 --> 01:22:09,477
I don't want my father
bothered anymore.

989
01:22:09,501 --> 01:22:13,562
He won't be, Mike.
I swear on my children he won't be.

990
01:22:13,672 --> 01:22:16,903
But you got to keep an open mind
when we talk.

991
01:22:17,009 --> 01:22:19,487
I mean, I hope you're not a hot-head
like your brother Sonny.

992
01:22:19,511 --> 01:22:22,011
You can't talk business
with him.

993
01:22:23,182 --> 01:22:25,682
He's a good kid.

994
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:31,521
I'm sorry about
the other night, Mike.

995
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:35,103
I gotta frisk you,
so turn around, huh?

996
01:22:35,127 --> 01:22:37,627
On your knees, facing me.

997
01:22:41,467 --> 01:22:44,368
I guess I'm getting
too old for my job.

998
01:22:45,471 --> 01:22:47,515
Too grouchy.

999
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:50,201
Can't stand the aggravation.

1000
01:36:26,491 --> 01:36:30,325
Driving them new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

1001
01:36:30,428 --> 01:36:33,829
I knew that was gonna happen as soon
as they started making big money.

1002
01:36:33,932 --> 01:36:37,493
Look, Papa never talked business
at the table in front of the kids.

1003
01:36:37,602 --> 01:36:40,332
- Hey, shut up, Connie.
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

1004
01:36:40,438 --> 01:36:43,498
- You got that?
- Santino, don't interfere.

1005
01:36:45,443 --> 01:36:48,043
You know, Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk
to you, maybe after dinner.

1006
01:36:48,113 --> 01:36:50,091
I could be doing a lot more
for the family.

1007
01:36:50,115 --> 01:36:52,615
We don't discuss business
at the table.

1008
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,230
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

1009
01:37:45,537 --> 01:37:47,037
Michael

1010
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:49,780
Why are you so far
from the house?

1011
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:53,110
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

1012
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,490
The bodyguards are here.

1013
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:56,740
It's still dangerous...

1014
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:59,620
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

1015
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,290
Your enemies know you're here.

1016
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:07,040
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

1017
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:09,000
Not yet.

1018
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:11,510
It's out of the question.

1019
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:16,390
Where are you going now?

1020
01:38:17,026 --> 01:38:18,026
Corleone.

1021
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:19,100
To Corleone.

1022
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,970
Take my car.

1023
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:25,350
I want to walk.

1024
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:29,150
Be careful.

1025
01:38:49,539 --> 01:38:51,539
Look there. Corleone.

1026
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,060
Where have all the men gone?

1027
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,310
They're all dead from vendettas.

1028
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:12,360
There are the names of the dead.

1029
01:39:28,876 --> 01:39:32,209
Hey, American!
Take me to the America! G.I.!

1030
01:39:32,776 --> 01:39:33,776
Hey, hey, hey!

1031
01:39:33,815 --> 01:39:36,875
Take me to America, G.I.
Clark Gable.

1032
01:39:37,376 --> 01:39:38,853
America! America!

1033
01:39:38,877 --> 01:39:40,354
Take me to the America, G.I.

1034
01:39:40,378 --> 01:39:42,378
Clark Gable. Rita Hayworth.

1035
01:40:00,570 --> 01:40:02,620
Mamma mia what a beauty.

1036
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:13,880
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

1037
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:24,100
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

1038
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:37,696
Hey, host.

1039
01:40:39,397 --> 01:40:41,397
A bottle of wine.

1040
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:48,950
Did you have a good hunt?

1041
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:52,290
You know all the girls
around here?

1042
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:54,290
We saw some real beauties.

1043
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:58,630
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

1044
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,600
She would tempt the devil himself.

1045
01:41:12,230 --> 01:41:14,400
Really put together.

1046
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,520
Right, Calo?

1047
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,280
Such hair, such mouth!

1048
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:26,830
The girls around here are
beautiful... but virtuous.

1049
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:29,750
This one had a purple dress...

1050
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,250
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

1051
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:36,290
A type more Greek than Italian.

1052
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:40,550
Do you know her?

1053
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:47,760
There's no girl like that
in this town.

1054
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:51,680
My God, I understand!

1055
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:56,810
What's wrong?

1056
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:00,400
Let's go.

1057
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,610
It's his daughter.

1058
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:05,570
Tell him to come here.

1059
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:10,330
Call him.

1060
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:32,720
Fabrizio, you translate.

1061
01:42:36,697 --> 01:42:39,197
I apologize if I offended you.

1062
01:42:40,034 --> 01:42:42,534
I'm a stranger in this country...

1063
01:42:43,037 --> 01:42:45,938
and I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

1064
01:42:51,712 --> 01:42:54,212
I'm an American hiding in Sicily.

1065
01:42:55,883 --> 01:42:58,383
My name is Michael Corleone.

1066
01:43:00,221 --> 01:43:02,862
There are people who would pay
a lot of money for that information.

1067
01:43:06,727 --> 01:43:09,227
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

1068
01:43:11,165 --> 01:43:13,665
instead of gaining a husband.

1069
01:43:21,409 --> 01:43:23,909
I want to meet your daughter...

1070
01:43:24,745 --> 01:43:26,556
with your permission...

1071
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:29,080
and under the supervision
of your family...

1072
01:43:30,017 --> 01:43:32,517
with all respect.

1073
01:43:37,790 --> 01:43:41,790
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

1074
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,800
What's her name?

1075
01:43:50,204 --> 01:43:52,704
Apollonia.

1076
01:44:47,205 --> 01:44:50,182
...this is my daughter, Apollonia...

1077
01:44:50,206 --> 01:44:53,206
and this is Michael Corleone.

1078
01:45:09,207 --> 01:45:11,207
Thank you.

1079
01:45:11,808 --> 01:45:13,808
Your welcome.

1080
01:45:23,809 --> 01:45:26,309
What's the problem with your eye.

1081
01:45:26,810 --> 01:45:29,310
No, no. It's nothing. It's fine.

1082
01:46:44,011 --> 01:46:46,511
Hey! I'm gonna knock you dizzy.

1083
01:46:52,019 --> 01:46:54,519
Save it for the library.

1084
01:46:57,658 --> 01:47:00,158
Come on. We gotta go
pick up my sister. Let's go.

1085
01:47:18,379 --> 01:47:20,879
What's the matter?

1086
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,680
What's the matter?

1087
01:47:25,886 --> 01:47:28,031
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

1088
01:47:28,055 --> 01:47:31,456
Sonny, please. It was my fault.
Sonny, it was my fault. I hit him.

1089
01:47:31,559 --> 01:47:33,470
I started a fight with him.
Please, Sonny.

1090
01:47:33,494 --> 01:47:35,994
I'm sorry.

1091
01:47:39,968 --> 01:47:43,298
Okay, I'm just... I'm just gonna get a
doctor to come and take a look at you.

1092
01:47:43,504 --> 01:47:46,234
Sonny, please don't do anything.
Please, don't do it.

1093
01:47:48,342 --> 01:47:50,487
What's the matter with you?
What am I gonna do?

1094
01:47:50,511 --> 01:47:53,309
Am I gonna make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

1095
01:47:56,183 --> 01:47:57,661
All right?

1096
01:47:57,685 --> 01:48:00,779
Still betting the Yankees
pretty heavy?

1097
01:48:00,888 --> 01:48:03,388
Tell him to stop
taking action, all right?

1098
01:48:04,558 --> 01:48:07,058
You lost enough money
last weekend to me.

1099
01:48:12,933 --> 01:48:15,433
Carlo, come here.

1100
01:49:12,526 --> 01:49:15,256
You touch my sister again,
I'll kill you.

1101
01:53:10,597 --> 01:53:13,327
Weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

1102
01:53:13,433 --> 01:53:17,733
Yes, well, I have.
I mean I've tried writing and calling.

1103
01:53:17,838 --> 01:53:20,183
Now, I wanna reach Michael.

1104
01:53:20,207 --> 01:53:23,608
Nobody knows where he is. We know
that he's all right, but that's all.

1105
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,858
- What was that?
- That's an accident.

1106
01:53:28,882 --> 01:53:31,578
But nobody was hurt.

1107
01:53:31,652 --> 01:53:32,652
Tom...

1108
01:53:33,153 --> 01:53:36,987
Would you give this letter
to Michael, please? Please?

1109
01:53:37,090 --> 01:53:39,402
Well, if I accepted that...

1110
01:53:39,426 --> 01:53:42,987
in a court of law they could prove that
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

1111
01:53:43,096 --> 01:53:45,816
Now you just be patient, Kay.
He'll get in touch with you, all right?

1112
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:49,201
I let my cab go, so can I come in
to call another one, please?

1113
01:53:49,303 --> 01:53:51,803
Come on. I'm sorry. Come on.

1114
01:54:08,121 --> 01:54:10,621
Hello?

1115
01:54:12,192 --> 01:54:13,937
<i>Is Carlo there?</i>

1116
01:54:13,961 --> 01:54:16,406
<i>- Who's this?
- This is a friend of Carlo's.</i>

1117
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:19,490
<i>Would you tell him that
I can't make it tonight until later?</i>

1118
01:54:25,706 --> 01:54:28,206
Bitch.

1119
01:54:28,976 --> 01:54:31,570
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry yet.

1120
01:54:31,678 --> 01:54:33,656
Your food is on the table.
It's getting cold.

1121
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:36,740
- I'll eat out later.
- You just told me to make you dinner.

1122
01:54:36,850 --> 01:54:38,828
Hey, fuck you, eh?

1123
01:54:38,852 --> 01:54:41,352
Go fuck yourself!

1124
01:54:46,059 --> 01:54:48,559
This little guinea brat.

1125
01:54:52,966 --> 01:54:55,560
That's it. Break it all,
you spoiled guinea brat.

1126
01:54:55,669 --> 01:54:58,169
Break it all!

1127
01:55:00,874 --> 01:55:03,374
That's it. Break it all.

1128
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:10,678
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

1129
01:55:10,784 --> 01:55:13,284
Maybe I will. Why not?

1130
01:55:18,959 --> 01:55:21,404
- Now clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

1131
01:55:21,428 --> 01:55:23,906
Clean it up,
you guinea spoiled brat!

1132
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:26,430
Clean it up! Clean it up!

1133
01:55:30,837 --> 01:55:33,337
You son of a bitch!

1134
01:55:42,015 --> 01:55:45,109
Come on, now! Kill me!
Be a murderer like your father!

1135
01:55:45,218 --> 01:55:47,530
- Come on! All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

1136
01:55:47,554 --> 01:55:49,265
- Come on!
- I'll kill you!

1137
01:55:49,289 --> 01:55:51,768
Kill me! Get up!

1138
01:55:51,792 --> 01:55:53,403
Get out of here!

1139
01:55:53,427 --> 01:55:56,919
- I hate you!
- Now go ahead. Now I'll kill you.

1140
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:59,008
You guinea brat, you.

1141
01:55:59,032 --> 01:56:01,532
Get out here!

1142
01:56:10,377 --> 01:56:13,312
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you. What is it?

1143
01:56:14,481 --> 01:56:17,348
Honey, talk louder.
The baby's crying.

1144
01:56:17,451 --> 01:56:19,462
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

1145
01:56:19,486 --> 01:56:21,531
I don't understand.

1146
01:56:21,555 --> 01:56:24,055
Yeah, Connie.

1147
01:56:28,595 --> 01:56:31,095
Listen, you wait there.

1148
01:56:32,966 --> 01:56:35,466
No, you just wait there.

1149
01:56:37,270 --> 01:56:40,171
- That son of a bitch.
- Sonny, what's the matter?

1150
01:56:40,273 --> 01:56:42,385
- Son of a bitch!
- What's the matter?

1151
01:56:42,409 --> 01:56:44,909
Damn it!

1152
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:49,708
Open the goddamn gate.
Get off your ass.

1153
01:57:06,233 --> 01:57:09,066
- Sonny, come on!
- Get out of here!

1154
01:57:09,169 --> 01:57:11,669
Go after him. Go on.

1155
01:57:40,066 --> 01:57:41,978
Son of a bitch.

1156
01:57:42,002 --> 01:57:44,502
Come on! Come on!

1157
01:59:31,578 --> 01:59:34,078
Give me a drop.

1158
01:59:41,688 --> 01:59:44,188
My wife is crying upstairs.

1159
01:59:46,359 --> 01:59:48,859
I hear cars coming to the house.

1160
01:59:53,433 --> 01:59:55,933
Consigliere of mine...

1161
01:59:56,803 --> 01:59:59,738
I think you should tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

1162
01:59:59,839 --> 02:00:02,339
Well, I didn't tell Mama anything.

1163
02:00:03,543 --> 02:00:07,070
I was about to come up and wake you
just now and tell you.

1164
02:00:10,216 --> 02:00:12,716
But you needed a drink first.

1165
02:00:19,292 --> 02:00:21,792
Now you've had your drink.

1166
02:00:27,334 --> 02:00:31,498
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

1167
02:00:48,788 --> 02:00:51,288
I want all inquiries made.

1168
02:00:55,462 --> 02:00:57,962
I want no acts of vengeance.

1169
02:00:59,499 --> 02:01:01,999
I want you to arrange a meeting...

1170
02:01:03,303 --> 02:01:05,803
with the heads
of the five families.

1171
02:01:08,041 --> 02:01:10,541
This war stops now.

1172
02:01:31,998 --> 02:01:34,523
Call Bonasera.

1173
02:01:34,634 --> 02:01:37,134
We need him now.

1174
02:01:48,982 --> 02:01:51,951
This is Tom Hagen
calling for Vito Corleone...

1175
02:01:52,052 --> 02:01:54,130
at his request.

1176
02:01:54,154 --> 02:01:56,432
Now, you owe your Don a service.

1177
02:01:56,456 --> 02:02:00,290
<i>He has no doubt that
you will repay it.</i>

1178
02:02:00,393 --> 02:02:03,157
<i>Now, he will be at your
funeral parlor in one hour.</i>

1179
02:02:03,263 --> 02:02:05,763
<i>Be there to greet him.</i>

1180
02:02:25,985 --> 02:02:28,297
Well, my friend...

1181
02:02:28,321 --> 02:02:30,766
are you ready
to do me this service?

1182
02:02:30,790 --> 02:02:32,435
Yes.

1183
02:02:32,459 --> 02:02:34,984
What do you want me to do?

1184
02:02:42,335 --> 02:02:45,361
I want you to use
all your powers...

1185
02:02:45,472 --> 02:02:47,972
and all your skills.

1186
02:02:50,977 --> 02:02:53,477
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

1187
02:03:10,029 --> 02:03:12,529
Look how they massacred my boy.

1188
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:45,250
It's safer to teach you English!

1189
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,376
I know English...

1190
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:49,278
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday...

1191
02:03:49,302 --> 02:03:51,930
Wednesday, Friday,
Sunday, Saturday.

1192
02:03:59,510 --> 02:04:01,300
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

1193
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:04,010
How are things in Palermo?

1194
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:14,070
Michael is teaching me to
drive... watch, I'll show you.

1195
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:18,700
How are things in Palermo?

1196
02:04:19,070 --> 02:04:22,200
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

1197
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:26,660
times are changing for the worse.

1198
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:32,330
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

1199
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:40,220
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

1200
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:47,390
What's wrong?

1201
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,730
Bad news from America.

1202
02:04:53,190 --> 02:04:56,900
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

1203
02:05:03,490 --> 02:05:05,330
Let's go... you promised.

1204
02:05:24,117 --> 02:05:25,117
Fabrizio!

1205
02:05:25,141 --> 02:05:25,196
- Fabrizio.
- Yes, sir?

1206
02:05:25,220 --> 02:05:26,640
Get the car.

1207
02:05:27,967 --> 02:05:29,612
Are you driving yourself, boss?

1208
02:05:29,636 --> 02:05:31,914
- Yes.
- Is your wife coming with you?

1209
02:05:31,938 --> 02:05:35,499
No. I want you to take her to her father's
house till I know things are safe.

1210
02:05:35,608 --> 02:05:38,108
Okay. Anything you say, boss.

1211
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:45,530
Calo, where is Apollonia?

1212
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:49,790
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

1213
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:54,120
She'll make a good American wife.

1214
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:58,130
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

1215
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:10,560
Fabrizio!

1216
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:12,310
Where are you going?

1217
02:06:14,020 --> 02:06:16,440
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

1218
02:06:47,146 --> 02:06:49,058
Don Barzini,
I want to thank you...

1219
02:06:49,082 --> 02:06:52,609
for helping me organize
this meeting here today.

1220
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:56,086
And also the other heads
of the five families...

1221
02:06:56,189 --> 02:06:58,689
from New York and New Jersey.

1222
02:06:59,692 --> 02:07:02,718
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx.

1223
02:07:05,198 --> 02:07:07,698
From Brooklyn...

1224
02:07:07,867 --> 02:07:10,367
Philip Tattaglia.

1225
02:07:11,771 --> 02:07:14,604
And from Staten Island...

1226
02:07:14,707 --> 02:07:17,972
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1227
02:07:18,077 --> 02:07:20,577
And all the other associates
that came as far...

1228
02:07:20,646 --> 02:07:23,774
as from California
and Kansas City...

1229
02:07:23,883 --> 02:07:26,295
and all the other territories
of the country.

1230
02:07:26,319 --> 02:07:28,819
Thank you.

1231
02:07:34,427 --> 02:07:36,927
How did things ever get so far?

1232
02:07:37,964 --> 02:07:40,464
I don't know.

1233
02:07:41,701 --> 02:07:45,193
It was so unfortunate
and so unnecessary.

1234
02:07:48,274 --> 02:07:50,486
Tattaglia lost a son...

1235
02:07:50,510 --> 02:07:53,010
and I lost a son.

1236
02:07:53,746 --> 02:07:57,341
We're quits,
and if Tattaglia agrees...

1237
02:07:57,450 --> 02:08:01,511
then I'm willing to let things
go on the way they were before.

1238
02:08:03,156 --> 02:08:06,683
We are all grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

1239
02:08:06,793 --> 02:08:09,489
We all know him
as a man of his word.

1240
02:08:09,595 --> 02:08:11,807
A modest man.
He'll always listen to reason.

1241
02:08:11,831 --> 02:08:14,331
Yes, Don Barzini.

1242
02:08:14,367 --> 02:08:16,412
He's too modest.

1243
02:08:16,436 --> 02:08:19,405
He had all the judges
and politicians in his pocket.

1244
02:08:20,807 --> 02:08:23,640
He refused to share them.

1245
02:08:23,743 --> 02:08:26,735
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1246
02:08:27,613 --> 02:08:30,113
All of you know me here.

1247
02:08:30,983 --> 02:08:35,010
When did I ever refuse,
except one time?

1248
02:08:35,121 --> 02:08:37,621
And why?

1249
02:08:37,790 --> 02:08:40,290
Because I believe
this drug business...

1250
02:08:40,393 --> 02:08:43,521
is going to destroy us
in the years to come.

1251
02:08:43,629 --> 02:08:47,360
I mean, it's not like gambling
or liquor or even women...

1252
02:08:47,467 --> 02:08:50,197
which is something that
most people want nowadays...

1253
02:08:50,303 --> 02:08:53,761
and is forbidden to them by
the pezzonovante of the church.

1254
02:08:53,873 --> 02:08:56,967
Even the police departments
that have helped us in the past...

1255
02:08:57,076 --> 02:08:58,887
with gambling and other things...

1256
02:08:58,911 --> 02:09:03,041
are gonna refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1257
02:09:03,149 --> 02:09:06,084
And I believed that then...

1258
02:09:06,185 --> 02:09:08,297
and I believe that now.

1259
02:09:08,321 --> 02:09:10,599
Times have changed.

1260
02:09:10,623 --> 02:09:12,868
It's not like the old days...

1261
02:09:12,892 --> 02:09:15,392
when we could do
anything we want.

1262
02:09:15,428 --> 02:09:18,329
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1263
02:09:18,431 --> 02:09:22,367
If Don Corleone had all the judges
and the politicians in New York...

1264
02:09:22,468 --> 02:09:25,460
then he must share them
or let others use them.

1265
02:09:25,571 --> 02:09:28,734
He must let us draw
the water from the well.

1266
02:09:29,675 --> 02:09:33,236
Certainly, he can present a bill
for such services.

1267
02:09:33,346 --> 02:09:36,076
After all, we are not Communists.

1268
02:09:39,051 --> 02:09:42,111
I also don't believe in drugs.

1269
02:09:42,221 --> 02:09:44,433
For years,
I paid my people extra...

1270
02:09:44,457 --> 02:09:46,835
so they wouldn't do
that kind of business.

1271
02:09:46,859 --> 02:09:50,295
Somebody comes to them and says,
"I have powders.

1272
02:09:50,396 --> 02:09:53,126
If you put up a three, four
thousand dollar investment,

1273
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:56,762
we can make 50,000 distributing."

1274
02:09:57,870 --> 02:10:01,670
So they can't resist. I want
to control it as a business...

1275
02:10:01,774 --> 02:10:04,219
to keep it respectable.

1276
02:10:04,243 --> 02:10:08,771
I don't want it near schools.
I don't want it sold to children.

1277
02:10:08,881 --> 02:10:11,381
That's an infamia.

1278
02:10:11,918 --> 02:10:15,854
In my city, we would keep the traffic
in the dark people, the colored.

1279
02:10:15,955 --> 02:10:18,822
They're animals anyway,
so let them lose their souls.

1280
02:10:25,798 --> 02:10:29,097
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1281
02:10:30,836 --> 02:10:33,999
And as a reasonable man, I'm willing
to do whatever's necessary...

1282
02:10:34,106 --> 02:10:37,598
to find a peaceful solution
to these problems.

1283
02:10:37,710 --> 02:10:39,855
Then we are agreed.

1284
02:10:39,879 --> 02:10:42,291
The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1285
02:10:42,315 --> 02:10:44,875
And Don Corleone will give our
protection in the east...

1286
02:10:44,984 --> 02:10:46,895
and there will be the peace.

1287
02:10:46,919 --> 02:10:50,787
But I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1288
02:10:50,890 --> 02:10:54,053
As time goes by and
his position becomes stronger...

1289
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:56,685
will he attempt
any individual vendetta?

1290
02:10:56,796 --> 02:10:58,840
Look, we are all
reasonable men here.

1291
02:10:58,864 --> 02:11:02,300
We don't have to give assurances
as if we were lawyers.

1292
02:11:02,401 --> 02:11:04,613
You talk about vengeance.

1293
02:11:04,637 --> 02:11:07,902
Is vengeance gonna bring
your son back to you?

1294
02:11:08,007 --> 02:11:10,507
Or my boy to me?

1295
02:11:11,177 --> 02:11:13,677
I forego the vengeance of my son.

1296
02:11:16,816 --> 02:11:19,316
But I have selfish reasons.

1297
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:23,332
My youngest son...

1298
02:11:23,356 --> 02:11:25,856
was forced to leave this country...

1299
02:11:26,859 --> 02:11:29,359
because of this Sollozzo business.

1300
02:11:29,829 --> 02:11:32,662
All right.
And I have to make arrangements...

1301
02:11:32,765 --> 02:11:37,395
to bring him back here safely,
cleared of all these false charges.

1302
02:11:39,038 --> 02:11:42,064
But I'm a superstitious man.

1303
02:11:42,174 --> 02:11:44,734
And if some unlucky accident
should befall him...

1304
02:11:44,844 --> 02:11:48,575
if he should get shot
in the head by a police officer...

1305
02:11:48,681 --> 02:11:52,515
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell...

1306
02:11:52,618 --> 02:11:55,118
of if he's struck
by a bolt of lightening...

1307
02:11:56,756 --> 02:11:59,782
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1308
02:12:01,994 --> 02:12:04,494
And that I do not forgive.

1309
02:12:06,832 --> 02:12:09,332
But that aside...

1310
02:12:12,271 --> 02:12:14,771
let me say that I swear...

1311
02:12:16,208 --> 02:12:19,302
on the souls of my grandchildren...

1312
02:12:19,412 --> 02:12:22,939
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1313
02:12:49,341 --> 02:12:51,581
When I meet with the Tattaglia
people, should I insist...

1314
02:12:51,605 --> 02:12:54,710
that all these drug middlemen
have clean records?

1315
02:12:54,814 --> 02:12:57,314
Mention it. Don't insist.

1316
02:12:59,151 --> 02:13:01,651
Barzini is a man who'll know that
without being told.

1317
02:13:02,988 --> 02:13:05,582
You mean Tattaglia.

1318
02:13:05,691 --> 02:13:08,421
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1319
02:13:08,527 --> 02:13:11,027
He never could've outfought Santino.

1320
02:13:14,366 --> 02:13:18,029
But I didn't know until this day
that it was...

1321
02:13:18,137 --> 02:13:20,637
Barzini all along.

1322
02:13:35,287 --> 02:13:37,787
Come on, Nancy.

1323
02:13:38,491 --> 02:13:40,991
Keep together, everyone. Brian?

1324
02:13:42,361 --> 02:13:44,861
Okay. All right.

1325
02:13:57,409 --> 02:13:59,934
How long have you been back?

1326
02:14:00,045 --> 02:14:02,545
I've been back a year.

1327
02:14:03,482 --> 02:14:06,007
Longer than that, I think.

1328
02:14:08,254 --> 02:14:10,754
It's good to see you, Kay.

1329
02:14:16,662 --> 02:14:19,162
Hi, Miss Adams!

1330
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:24,000
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1331
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:28,650
He's been sick.

1332
02:14:28,674 --> 02:14:31,086
Very sick.

1333
02:14:31,110 --> 02:14:33,188
But you're not like him, Michael.

1334
02:14:33,212 --> 02:14:35,737
I thought you weren't going
to become a man like your father.

1335
02:14:35,848 --> 02:14:38,348
That's what you told me.

1336
02:14:38,884 --> 02:14:41,614
My father's no different
than any other powerful man.

1337
02:14:43,289 --> 02:14:46,850
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1338
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:50,438
Like a senator or a president.

1339
02:14:50,462 --> 02:14:52,987
- Do you know how naive you sound?
- Why?

1340
02:14:53,098 --> 02:14:55,692
Senators and presidents
don't have men killed.

1341
02:14:57,037 --> 02:14:58,037
Oh.

1342
02:14:59,038 --> 02:15:01,538
Who's being naive, Kay?

1343
02:15:02,174 --> 02:15:04,386
Kay, my father's way
of doing things is over.

1344
02:15:04,410 --> 02:15:07,902
It's finished.
Even he knows that.

1345
02:15:08,013 --> 02:15:10,025
I mean, in five years
the Corleone family...

1346
02:15:10,049 --> 02:15:12,549
is going to be completely legitimate.

1347
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:17,164
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business.

1348
02:15:17,188 --> 02:15:18,188
Kay.

1349
02:15:19,658 --> 02:15:22,003
Michael, why did you come here?

1350
02:15:22,027 --> 02:15:24,206
Why?

1351
02:15:24,230 --> 02:15:26,274
What do you want with me
after all this time...

1352
02:15:26,298 --> 02:15:28,823
without even calling or writing?

1353
02:15:28,934 --> 02:15:30,912
I came here because I need you.

1354
02:15:30,936 --> 02:15:33,461
- Because I care for you.
- Please stop it, Michael.

1355
02:15:33,572 --> 02:15:36,700
Because I want you to marry me.

1356
02:15:38,210 --> 02:15:40,710
- It's too late. It's too late.
- Please. Kay.

1357
02:15:42,414 --> 02:15:46,282
I'll do anything you ask, anything to
make up for what's happened to us.

1358
02:15:48,087 --> 02:15:50,398
Because that's important, Kay.

1359
02:15:50,422 --> 02:15:53,914
Because what's important is that...

1360
02:15:54,026 --> 02:15:55,837
we have each other.

1361
02:15:55,861 --> 02:15:58,762
That we have a life together.

1362
02:15:58,864 --> 02:16:02,322
That we have children.
Our children.

1363
02:16:02,823 --> 02:16:03,823
Kay...

1364
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:07,200
I need you...

1365
02:16:07,306 --> 02:16:09,806
and I love you.

1366
02:16:30,930 --> 02:16:32,908
Barzini's people
chisel my territory...

1367
02:16:32,932 --> 02:16:34,776
and we do nothing about it.

1368
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:37,481
Pretty soon, there won't be one place
in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

1369
02:16:37,536 --> 02:16:40,061
- Just be patient.
- I'm not askin' you for help, Mike.

1370
02:16:40,172 --> 02:16:42,697
- Just take off the handcuffs.
- Be patient.

1371
02:16:42,808 --> 02:16:44,920
We gotta protect ourselves.

1372
02:16:44,944 --> 02:16:46,922
Give me a chance to recruit
some new men.

1373
02:16:46,946 --> 02:16:48,556
No.

1374
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:51,080
I don't wanna give Barzini
an excuse to start fighting.

1375
02:16:51,150 --> 02:16:53,675
Mike, you're wrong.

1376
02:16:53,786 --> 02:16:57,415
Don Corleone, you once said that the day would come...

1377
02:16:57,523 --> 02:17:00,219
when Tessio and me
could form our own family.

1378
02:17:00,326 --> 02:17:02,304
Till today,
I would never think of it.

1379
02:17:02,328 --> 02:17:04,673
I must ask your permission.

1380
02:17:04,697 --> 02:17:07,928
Well, Michael is now
head of the family...

1381
02:17:08,033 --> 02:17:10,729
and if he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1382
02:17:12,304 --> 02:17:14,804
After we make the move to Nevada...

1383
02:17:14,907 --> 02:17:17,899
you can break off from the Corleone
family and go on your own.

1384
02:17:18,010 --> 02:17:20,808
- After we make the move to Nevada.
- How long will that be?

1385
02:17:22,047 --> 02:17:23,658
Six months.

1386
02:17:23,682 --> 02:17:27,140
Forgive me, Godfather,
but with you gone...

1387
02:17:27,252 --> 02:17:30,221
me and Pete'll come under
Barzini's thumb sooner or later.

1388
02:17:30,322 --> 02:17:32,822
And I hate that goddamn Barzini.

1389
02:17:32,858 --> 02:17:35,793
In six months' time, there won't be
nothing left to build on.

1390
02:17:35,894 --> 02:17:38,886
- You have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1391
02:17:38,998 --> 02:17:41,796
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Yes, always, Godfather.

1392
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:44,145
Then be a friend to Michael...

1393
02:17:44,169 --> 02:17:46,669
and do as he says.

1394
02:17:50,109 --> 02:17:52,629
There are things being negotiated
now that are going to solve...

1395
02:17:52,653 --> 02:17:55,405
all your problems
and answer all your questions.

1396
02:17:55,514 --> 02:17:58,014
That's all I can tell you now.

1397
02:17:58,517 --> 02:18:01,145
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1398
02:18:01,253 --> 02:18:04,416
When we make our move there,
you're gonna be my right-hand man.

1399
02:18:04,523 --> 02:18:07,219
Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.

1400
02:18:07,326 --> 02:18:09,804
He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.

1401
02:18:09,828 --> 02:18:12,273
That's no reflection on Tom,
but that's the way I want it.

1402
02:18:12,297 --> 02:18:14,209
Besides, if I ever need help...

1403
02:18:14,233 --> 02:18:16,511
who's a better consigliere
than my father?

1404
02:18:16,535 --> 02:18:19,035
Now that's it.

1405
02:18:37,122 --> 02:18:39,622
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1406
02:18:41,028 --> 02:18:45,258
Mike, ehh... Why am I out?

1407
02:18:45,364 --> 02:18:47,864
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1408
02:18:49,435 --> 02:18:51,935
Things may get rough
with the move we're trying.

1409
02:18:52,636 --> 02:18:53,636
Tom...

1410
02:18:59,211 --> 02:19:01,456
I advised Michael.

1411
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:04,381
I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1412
02:19:04,483 --> 02:19:07,748
I thought Santino was a bad Don...

1413
02:19:07,853 --> 02:19:10,098
rest in peace.

1414
02:19:10,122 --> 02:19:13,148
Michael has all my confidence,
as, as you do.

1415
02:19:14,359 --> 02:19:17,886
But there are reasons why
you must have no part...

1416
02:19:17,996 --> 02:19:20,208
in what is going to happen.

1417
02:19:20,232 --> 02:19:21,709
Maybe I could help.

1418
02:19:21,733 --> 02:19:24,233
You're out, Tom.

1419
02:20:12,651 --> 02:20:15,176
I can't get over the way
your face looks.

1420
02:20:15,287 --> 02:20:18,450
It really looks good.
This doctor did some job.

1421
02:20:18,557 --> 02:20:21,185
Who talked you into it, Kay?
Hey, hey, wait.

1422
02:20:21,293 --> 02:20:23,671
Leave them out here.
We'll deal with them later.

1423
02:20:23,695 --> 02:20:25,673
He's tired.
He wants to clean up.

1424
02:20:25,697 --> 02:20:28,757
For right now, let me open the door.
All right?

1425
02:20:34,306 --> 02:20:36,618
Hello, Mike.
Welcome to Las Vegas.

1426
02:20:36,642 --> 02:20:39,907
All for you, kid.
It was all his idea, right?

1427
02:20:40,012 --> 02:20:42,810
- Well, your brother, Freddy...
- It was... Girls?

1428
02:20:46,552 --> 02:20:49,350
I'll be right back.
You keep them occupied.

1429
02:20:49,454 --> 02:20:52,389
That a boy.
Anything you want, kid, anything. Huh?

1430
02:20:52,491 --> 02:20:54,991
Who are the girls?

1431
02:20:55,561 --> 02:20:57,539
That's for you to find out.

1432
02:20:57,563 --> 02:21:00,430
Get rid of them, Fredo.

1433
02:21:00,532 --> 02:21:02,644
- Hey, Mike...
- Fredo, I'm here on business.

1434
02:21:02,668 --> 02:21:06,399
I leave tomorrow.
Now, get rid of them. I'm tired.

1435
02:21:06,505 --> 02:21:09,005
Get rid of the band too.

1436
02:21:13,979 --> 02:21:16,777
Hey, just take off.
Come on. Let's go.

1437
02:21:16,882 --> 02:21:20,147
Hey, that's it.
Hey, Angelo, that's it.

1438
02:21:20,252 --> 02:21:22,263
Let's go. Hey, come on!

1439
02:21:22,287 --> 02:21:24,787
Scram!

1440
02:21:25,057 --> 02:21:27,402
Come on, honey. Let's go.
I don't know, Johnny.

1441
02:21:27,426 --> 02:21:29,786
I don't know what the hell's
the matter with him. I'm sorry.

1442
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:31,873
It's all right, Freddy.

1443
02:21:31,897 --> 02:21:34,397
I don't know.
He's tired, he's hot.

1444
02:21:41,406 --> 02:21:43,906
What happened to Moe Greene?

1445
02:21:44,509 --> 02:21:46,988
He said he had some business.
He said give him a call...

1446
02:21:47,012 --> 02:21:48,957
when the party started.

1447
02:21:48,981 --> 02:21:51,481
Well, give him a call.

1448
02:21:52,284 --> 02:21:55,378
- Johnny, how are you?
- Hello, Mike. Nice to see you again.

1449
02:21:55,487 --> 02:21:57,632
- We're all proud of you.
- Thanks, Mike.

1450
02:21:57,656 --> 02:22:00,034
Sit down, Johnny.
I want to talk to you.

1451
02:22:00,058 --> 02:22:04,495
- The Don's proud of you, too, Johnny.
- Well, I, owe it all to him.

1452
02:22:04,596 --> 02:22:06,608
Well, he knows
how grateful you are.

1453
02:22:06,632 --> 02:22:09,692
That's why he'd like to ask
a favor of you.

1454
02:22:09,801 --> 02:22:12,301
Mike, what can I do?

1455
02:22:13,090 --> 02:22:15,650
The Corleone family is thinking
of giving up all its interests...

1456
02:22:15,674 --> 02:22:19,075
in the olive oil business,
settling out here.

1457
02:22:19,177 --> 02:22:22,442
Now, Moe Greene will sell us his
share of the casino and the hotel...

1458
02:22:22,547 --> 02:22:25,141
so it can be completely owned
by the family. Tom?

1459
02:22:25,250 --> 02:22:27,528
Hey, Mike, are you sure about that?

1460
02:22:27,552 --> 02:22:30,419
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothin' to me about sellin'.

1461
02:22:30,522 --> 02:22:33,022
Well, I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

1462
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:37,171
See, Johnny...

1463
02:22:37,195 --> 02:22:39,474
see, we figure that entertainment
will be a big factor...

1464
02:22:39,498 --> 02:22:41,276
in drawing gamblers to the casino.

1465
02:22:41,300 --> 02:22:44,599
Now we hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1466
02:22:48,106 --> 02:22:51,371
Perhaps convince some of
your friends in the movies...

1467
02:22:51,476 --> 02:22:53,976
to do the same.

1468
02:22:54,046 --> 02:22:56,546
We're counting on you.

1469
02:22:58,150 --> 02:23:00,675
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1470
02:23:00,786 --> 02:23:02,096
You know that.

1471
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:04,620
Good.

1472
02:23:04,756 --> 02:23:06,968
Hey, Mike. Hello, fellas.

1473
02:23:06,992 --> 02:23:10,689
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
Good to see you, Mike.

1474
02:23:10,796 --> 02:23:12,807
- How are you, Moe?
- You got everything you want?

1475
02:23:12,831 --> 02:23:15,711
The chef cooked for you special, the
dancers will kick your tongue out...

1476
02:23:15,735 --> 02:23:17,378
and your credit is good.

1477
02:23:17,402 --> 02:23:20,043
Draw chips for everybody in the room
so they can play on the house.

1478
02:23:23,608 --> 02:23:26,108
My credit good enough
to buy you out?

1479
02:23:28,080 --> 02:23:29,991
Buy me out?

1480
02:23:30,015 --> 02:23:32,677
The casino. The hotel.

1481
02:23:32,784 --> 02:23:35,548
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1482
02:23:35,654 --> 02:23:38,521
The Corleone family
wants to buy me out?

1483
02:23:38,623 --> 02:23:41,123
No, I buy you out.
You don't buy me out.

1484
02:23:41,159 --> 02:23:44,424
Your casino loses money.
Maybe we can do better.

1485
02:23:44,529 --> 02:23:47,029
You think I'm skimming
off the top, Mike?

1486
02:23:47,833 --> 02:23:50,333
You're unlucky.

1487
02:23:53,505 --> 02:23:55,950
You goddamn guineas
really make me laugh.

1488
02:23:55,974 --> 02:23:58,807
I do you a favor and take Freddy in
when you're having a bad time.

1489
02:23:58,910 --> 02:24:01,356
- And then you try to push me out!
- Wait a minute.

1490
02:24:01,380 --> 02:24:03,974
You took Freddy in because
the Corleone family...

1491
02:24:04,082 --> 02:24:06,582
bankrolled your casino,
because the Molinari family...

1492
02:24:06,685 --> 02:24:08,796
on the coast guaranteed his safety.

1493
02:24:08,820 --> 02:24:10,865
Now, we're talkin' business.
Let's talk business.

1494
02:24:10,889 --> 02:24:13,619
Yeah, let's talk business, Mike.
First of all, you're all done.

1495
02:24:13,702 --> 02:24:16,222
The Corleone family don't even have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1496
02:24:16,246 --> 02:24:18,966
The Godfather's sick, right? You're
getting chased out of New York...

1497
02:24:18,990 --> 02:24:20,508
by Barzini and the other families.

1498
02:24:20,532 --> 02:24:24,434
What do you think is going on here? You
think you can come to my hotel and take over?

1499
02:24:24,536 --> 02:24:26,347
I talked to Barzini.

1500
02:24:26,371 --> 02:24:29,636
I can make a deal with him
and still keep my hotel.

1501
02:24:29,741 --> 02:24:32,335
Is that why you slapped
my brother around in public?

1502
02:24:33,412 --> 02:24:35,113
Oh, no, that was nothin', Mike.

1503
02:24:35,414 --> 02:24:37,974
Now, now, Moe didn't mean nothin' by that.

1504
02:24:38,083 --> 02:24:40,561
Sure he flies off the handle
once in a while...

1505
02:24:40,585 --> 02:24:42,697
but Moe and me,
we're good friends, right, Moe, huh?

1506
02:24:42,721 --> 02:24:44,565
I got a business to run.

1507
02:24:44,589 --> 02:24:47,319
I gotta kick asses sometimes
to make it run right.

1508
02:24:47,426 --> 02:24:51,419
We had a little argument, Freddy and I,
so I had to straighten him out.

1509
02:24:51,530 --> 02:24:54,124
You straightened my brother out?

1510
02:24:54,232 --> 02:24:56,711
He was banging cocktail waitresses
two at a time!

1511
02:24:56,735 --> 02:24:59,636
Players couldn't get a drink at the table.
What's wrong with you?

1512
02:25:05,677 --> 02:25:09,169
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1513
02:25:09,281 --> 02:25:10,958
Son of a bitch.

1514
02:25:10,982 --> 02:25:14,008
Do you know who I am?
I'm Moe Greene.

1515
02:25:14,119 --> 02:25:16,713
I made my bones when you were
going out with cheerleaders.

1516
02:25:16,822 --> 02:25:19,322
Wait a minute, Moe.
Moe, I got an idea.

1517
02:25:20,325 --> 02:25:23,522
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Now, you can talk to the Don.

1518
02:25:23,628 --> 02:25:25,606
- You can explain...
- Just a minute.

1519
02:25:25,630 --> 02:25:29,225
The Don is semiretired and Mike is
in charge of the family business now.

1520
02:25:29,334 --> 02:25:31,894
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1521
02:25:36,776 --> 02:25:41,371
Mike! You don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1522
02:25:43,717 --> 02:25:48,447
Fredo. You're my older brother,
and I love you.

1523
02:25:49,955 --> 02:25:51,999
But don't ever take sides
with anyone...

1524
02:25:52,023 --> 02:25:54,924
against the family again...

1525
02:25:55,026 --> 02:25:57,526
ever.

1526
02:26:04,336 --> 02:26:06,481
I have to see my father
and his people.

1527
02:26:06,505 --> 02:26:09,005
- So have dinner without me.
- Oh, Michael.

1528
02:26:10,509 --> 02:26:12,753
This weekend we'll go out.
We'll go to the city.

1529
02:26:12,777 --> 02:26:15,277
We'll see a show and we'll have dinner.
I promise.

1530
02:26:22,721 --> 02:26:25,622
Oh, Michael. Michael, your sister wants
to ask you something.

1531
02:26:25,724 --> 02:26:27,835
- Well, let her ask.
- No, she's afraid to.

1532
02:26:27,859 --> 02:26:31,090
Connie and Carlo want you to be
godfather to their little boy.

1533
02:26:31,196 --> 02:26:33,040
- Oh, we'll see.
- Will you?

1534
02:26:33,064 --> 02:26:35,564
Let me think about it. We'll see.
Come on.

1535
02:26:42,173 --> 02:26:44,085
So...

1536
02:26:44,109 --> 02:26:47,078
Barzini will move against you first.

1537
02:26:47,178 --> 02:26:51,512
He'll set up a meeting with
someone that you absolutely trust...

1538
02:26:51,616 --> 02:26:54,116
guaranteeing your safety.

1539
02:26:54,953 --> 02:26:58,218
And at that meeting,
you'll be assassinated.

1540
02:27:02,861 --> 02:27:06,058
I like to drink wine
more than I used to.

1541
02:27:07,232 --> 02:27:09,377
Anyway, I'm drinking more.

1542
02:27:09,401 --> 02:27:11,901
It's good for you, Pop.

1543
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:18,340
I don't know.

1544
02:27:19,244 --> 02:27:21,744
Your wife and children,
are you happy with them?

1545
02:27:23,148 --> 02:27:25,192
Very happy.

1546
02:27:25,216 --> 02:27:27,741
That's good.

1547
02:27:27,852 --> 02:27:30,097
I hope you don't mind
the way I...

1548
02:27:30,121 --> 02:27:32,715
I keep going over
this Barzini business.

1549
02:27:32,824 --> 02:27:34,869
No, not at all.

1550
02:27:34,893 --> 02:27:37,238
It's an old habit.

1551
02:27:37,262 --> 02:27:40,026
I spent my life
tryin' not to be careless.

1552
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:44,733
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1553
02:27:48,607 --> 02:27:51,167
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1554
02:27:51,276 --> 02:27:53,776
You know, he looks
more like you every day.

1555
02:27:56,581 --> 02:27:58,826
He's smarter than I am.

1556
02:27:58,850 --> 02:28:01,350
Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.

1557
02:28:03,154 --> 02:28:05,654
Reads the funny papers.

1558
02:28:12,397 --> 02:28:14,875
I want you to arrange
to have a telephone man...

1559
02:28:14,899 --> 02:28:18,027
check all the calls that go
in and out of here.

1560
02:28:18,136 --> 02:28:20,247
- I did it already, Pop.
- Could be anyone.

1561
02:28:20,271 --> 02:28:23,798
- Pop, I took care of that.
- Oh, that's right. I forgot.

1562
02:28:27,512 --> 02:28:29,890
What's the matter?

1563
02:28:29,914 --> 02:28:32,414
What's bothering you?

1564
02:28:35,186 --> 02:28:37,686
I'll handle it.

1565
02:28:38,089 --> 02:28:40,589
I told you I can handle it,
I'll handle it.

1566
02:28:53,638 --> 02:28:57,972
I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this...

1567
02:28:58,076 --> 02:28:59,954
and Fredo...

1568
02:28:59,978 --> 02:29:02,423
Well...

1569
02:29:02,447 --> 02:29:04,947
Fredo was...

1570
02:29:06,484 --> 02:29:09,248
But I never, I never wanted this for you.

1571
02:29:11,523 --> 02:29:14,356
I worked my whole life...
I don't apologize...

1572
02:29:14,459 --> 02:29:16,604
to take care of my family...

1573
02:29:16,628 --> 02:29:20,496
and I refused to be a fool...

1574
02:29:20,598 --> 02:29:24,659
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1575
02:29:26,771 --> 02:29:29,934
I don't apologize. That's my life.
But I thought that...

1576
02:29:31,910 --> 02:29:34,504
that when it was your time...

1577
02:29:34,612 --> 02:29:37,112
that you would be the one
to hold the strings.

1578
02:29:38,950 --> 02:29:41,450
Senator Corleone.

1579
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:44,565
Governor Corleone. Something.

1580
02:29:44,589 --> 02:29:47,089
Another pezzonovante.

1581
02:29:52,597 --> 02:29:56,431
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1582
02:29:56,534 --> 02:29:59,128
We'll get there, Pop.

1583
02:29:59,237 --> 02:30:01,737
We'll get there.

1584
02:30:04,976 --> 02:30:09,345
Now listen. Whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting...

1585
02:30:09,447 --> 02:30:11,192
he's the traitor.

1586
02:30:11,216 --> 02:30:13,716
Don't forget that.

1587
02:30:29,467 --> 02:30:31,967
Put it over the tree.

1588
02:30:46,751 --> 02:30:49,196
- Can I water these?
- Yeah.

1589
02:30:49,220 --> 02:30:50,765
That's fine.

1590
02:30:50,789 --> 02:30:53,289
Over here. Over here.

1591
02:30:55,393 --> 02:30:57,893
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1592
02:31:04,202 --> 02:31:06,702
Anthony, come here.

1593
02:31:12,110 --> 02:31:14,610
Go ahead. That's right.
We'll put it right there.

1594
02:31:20,418 --> 02:31:22,918
I'll show you something.
Come here.

1595
02:31:25,423 --> 02:31:27,923
Now, you stand there.

1596
02:31:31,029 --> 02:31:33,529
Give me an orange!

1597
02:31:51,115 --> 02:31:53,615
That's a new trick.

1598
02:31:54,185 --> 02:31:56,745
You run in there. Run in there.

1599
02:32:09,367 --> 02:32:11,867
- Where are you?
- Who?

1600
02:32:45,003 --> 02:32:47,503
Ouch!

1601
02:35:09,047 --> 02:35:11,547
Mike, can I have a minute?

1602
02:35:21,893 --> 02:35:24,338
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1603
02:35:24,362 --> 02:35:26,862
He says we can straighten
any of our problems out.

1604
02:35:28,533 --> 02:35:31,033
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1605
02:35:31,969 --> 02:35:34,381
I can arrange security...

1606
02:35:34,405 --> 02:35:36,905
on my territory.

1607
02:35:38,843 --> 02:35:40,821
All right?

1608
02:35:40,845 --> 02:35:43,678
- All right.
- All right.

1609
02:35:58,963 --> 02:36:01,463
Do you know how
they're gonna come at you?

1610
02:36:04,402 --> 02:36:06,814
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn.

1611
02:36:06,838 --> 02:36:09,338
Tessio's ground...

1612
02:36:10,208 --> 02:36:12,708
where I'll be safe.

1613
02:36:24,255 --> 02:36:27,850
I always thought it would've been
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1614
02:36:27,959 --> 02:36:30,304
It's the smart move.

1615
02:36:30,328 --> 02:36:32,828
Tessio was always smarter.

1616
02:36:34,031 --> 02:36:36,310
But I'm gonna wait.

1617
02:36:36,334 --> 02:36:38,834
After the baptism.

1618
02:36:40,805 --> 02:36:43,365
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1619
02:36:44,709 --> 02:36:47,644
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini...

1620
02:36:47,745 --> 02:36:50,190
and Tattaglia...

1621
02:36:50,214 --> 02:36:52,714
all the heads
of the five families.

1622
02:37:19,215 --> 02:37:21,215
Go forth from him, unclean spirit,

1623
02:37:21,416 --> 02:37:24,616
and give place to the Holy Spirit,
the Spirit of God.

1624
02:37:26,594 --> 02:37:27,594
Let us pray.

1625
02:37:27,618 --> 02:37:30,618
Our prayers through through
Christ our Lord. So be it.

1626
02:37:31,196 --> 02:37:32,196
Michael.

1627
02:37:32,220 --> 02:37:35,220
Signed with the sign of the Lord's cross,

1628
02:37:36,221 --> 02:37:39,198
so that, preserving this first experience
of the greatness of thy glory,

1629
02:37:39,222 --> 02:37:42,199
he may deserve, by keeping
thy commandments,

1630
02:37:42,223 --> 02:37:45,200
<i>to attain to the glory of regeneration.</i>

1631
02:37:45,224 --> 02:37:48,201
<i>Through Christ our Lord. So be it.</i>

1632
02:37:48,225 --> 02:37:51,202
<i>Let us pray.
Almighty, everlasting God,</i>

1633
02:37:51,226 --> 02:37:53,703
<i>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i>

1634
02:37:53,727 --> 02:37:56,704
<i>look graciously down upon this,
thy servant, Michael.</i>

1635
02:37:56,728 --> 02:37:59,705
Who shall come to judge the living
and the dead,

1636
02:37:59,729 --> 02:38:02,706
and the world by fire. So be it.

1637
02:38:02,730 --> 02:38:05,007
Michael. Receive the salt of wisdom.

1638
02:38:05,031 --> 02:38:07,308
Let it be to thee a token of mercy
unto everlasting life.

1639
02:38:07,332 --> 02:38:09,372
May it make your way easy to eternal life.
So be it.

1640
02:38:09,396 --> 02:38:11,810
May the almighty God, the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

1641
02:38:11,834 --> 02:38:14,334
<i>Who hath regenerated thee by water
and the Holy Spirit,</i>

1642
02:38:15,335 --> 02:38:17,835
<i>and who hath given thee the
remission of all thy sins,</i>

1643
02:38:18,336 --> 02:38:21,813
<i>may he, himself anoint thee with
the Chrism of Salvation,</i>

1644
02:38:21,837 --> 02:38:24,837
<i>in the same Christ Jesus our Lord,
unto life eternal. So be it.</i>

1645
02:38:25,838 --> 02:38:29,138
I annoint you with the oil of salvation
in Christ Jesus our Lord,

1646
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:32,439
that you may have everlasting life.
So be it.

1647
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:42,817
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1648
02:38:42,841 --> 02:38:45,818
<i>the communion of Saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1649
02:38:45,842 --> 02:38:49,342
<i>the resurrection of the body
and life everlasting? I do believe.</i>

1650
02:38:50,343 --> 02:38:53,320
I exorcise thee, unclean spirit,
in the name of the Father,

1651
02:38:53,344 --> 02:38:56,321
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

1652
02:38:56,345 --> 02:39:00,322
that thou goest out and depart from
this servant of God, Michael.

1653
02:39:00,346 --> 02:39:03,846
For he commands thee, accursed one,

1654
02:39:05,647 --> 02:39:08,624
Be opened, for an odor of sweetness.

1655
02:39:08,648 --> 02:39:11,625
Be thou, devil, begone,

1656
02:39:11,649 --> 02:39:13,949
for the judgment of God shall draw near.

1657
02:39:13,991 --> 02:39:16,892
Michael, do you believe in God,
the Father almighty...

1658
02:39:16,994 --> 02:39:19,963
- creator of Heaven and Earth?
- I do.

1659
02:39:20,064 --> 02:39:23,363
<i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
his only Son, our Lord?</i>

1660
02:39:23,467 --> 02:39:24,945
<i>I do.</i>

1661
02:39:24,969 --> 02:39:29,116
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?</i>

1662
02:39:29,140 --> 02:39:30,140
<i>I do.</i>

1663
02:39:30,441 --> 02:39:34,318
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.</i>

1664
02:39:34,342 --> 02:39:38,319
<i>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

1665
02:39:38,343 --> 02:39:41,120
<i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i>

1666
02:39:41,144 --> 02:39:43,144
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

1667
02:39:43,345 --> 02:39:46,415
<i>as we forgive them that
trespass against us.</i>

1668
02:39:46,439 --> 02:39:49,416
<i>And lead us not into temptation,</i>

1669
02:39:49,440 --> 02:39:51,417
<i>but deliver us from evil.
So be it.</i>

1670
02:39:51,441 --> 02:39:52,918
Michael.

1671
02:39:52,942 --> 02:39:55,919
Enter thou into the temple of God,

1672
02:39:55,943 --> 02:39:58,920
that thou mayest have part with Christ
unto life everlasting. So be it.

1673
02:39:58,944 --> 02:40:01,421
I believe in God the Father almighty,

1674
02:40:01,445 --> 02:40:03,422
Creator of heaven and earth,

1675
02:40:03,446 --> 02:40:06,923
<i>and in Jesus Christ his only
son our Lord,</i>

1676
02:40:06,947 --> 02:40:09,224
<i>who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,</i>

1677
02:40:09,248 --> 02:40:11,225
<i>born of the Virgin Mary,</i>

1678
02:40:11,249 --> 02:40:14,527
<i>suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, dead, and buried.</i>

1679
02:40:14,551 --> 02:40:17,228
<i>He descended into Hell.
On the third day,</i>

1680
02:40:17,252 --> 02:40:21,229
<i>He rose again from the dead.
He ascended into heaven,</i>

1681
02:40:21,253 --> 02:40:24,030
<i>and sitteth at the right hand of
God the Father almighty,</i>

1682
02:40:24,054 --> 02:40:26,531
<i>from thence shall he come to judge
the living and the dead.</i>

1683
02:40:26,555 --> 02:40:29,532
<i>I believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1684
02:40:29,556 --> 02:40:32,533
<i>the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1685
02:40:32,557 --> 02:40:35,357
<i>the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. So be it.</i>

1686
02:40:35,439 --> 02:40:40,376
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1687
02:40:46,784 --> 02:40:49,284
I do renounce him.

1688
02:40:57,595 --> 02:41:00,095
And all his works?

1689
02:41:12,309 --> 02:41:14,809
I do renounce them.

1690
02:41:19,683 --> 02:41:23,642
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1691
02:41:39,036 --> 02:41:43,097
Michael Rizzi,
will you be baptized?

1692
02:41:43,207 --> 02:41:45,184
I will.

1693
02:41:45,208 --> 02:41:47,485
In the name of the Father,

1694
02:41:47,509 --> 02:41:49,486
<i>and of the Son,</i>

1695
02:41:49,510 --> 02:41:51,910
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

1696
02:41:52,249 --> 02:41:54,809
<i>Michael Rizzi, go in peace.</i>

1697
02:41:54,919 --> 02:41:57,945
And may the Lord be with you.
So be it.

1698
02:42:40,064 --> 02:42:42,042
- Carlo.
- What?

1699
02:42:42,066 --> 02:42:44,277
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1700
02:42:44,301 --> 02:42:46,313
Everybody's gonna have to leave
without us.

1701
02:42:46,337 --> 02:42:48,897
- It's our first vacation together.
- Connie, please.

1702
02:42:49,006 --> 02:42:50,984
- What do you wanna do?
- Go back to the house.

1703
02:42:51,008 --> 02:42:53,875
Wait for my call.
It's important.

1704
02:42:53,978 --> 02:42:56,478
I'll only be a couple of days.

1705
02:42:58,916 --> 02:43:01,416
Have a nice trip, Mama.

1706
02:43:12,429 --> 02:43:14,929
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1707
02:43:16,767 --> 02:43:19,145
I hope Mike can get us
a good deal tonight.

1708
02:43:19,169 --> 02:43:21,669
I'm sure he will.

1709
02:43:28,412 --> 02:43:31,438
Sal, Tom, the boss says
he'll come in a separate car.

1710
02:43:31,549 --> 02:43:33,727
He says for you two
to go on ahead.

1711
02:43:33,751 --> 02:43:36,379
Hell, he can't do that.
It screws up all my arrangements.

1712
02:43:36,487 --> 02:43:38,987
- Well that's what he said.
- I can't go either, Sal.

1713
02:43:51,602 --> 02:43:54,366
Tell Mike it was only business.

1714
02:43:54,471 --> 02:43:56,971
I always liked him.

1715
02:43:57,141 --> 02:43:59,641
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1716
02:44:06,050 --> 02:44:08,550
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1717
02:44:09,653 --> 02:44:12,349
- For old times' sake.
- Can't do it, Sally.

1718
02:44:58,302 --> 02:45:00,802
You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.

1719
02:45:05,709 --> 02:45:07,520
Mike, you got it all wrong.

1720
02:45:07,544 --> 02:45:10,044
You fingered Sonny
for the Barzini people.

1721
02:45:11,649 --> 02:45:14,709
That little farce you played
with my sister.

1722
02:45:14,818 --> 02:45:16,796
Did you think that could fool
a Corleone?

1723
02:45:16,820 --> 02:45:19,983
Mike, I'm innocent.
I swear on the kids.

1724
02:45:20,090 --> 02:45:22,590
- Please, don't do this to me.
- Sit down.

1725
02:45:25,729 --> 02:45:28,229
Don't do this to me, please.

1726
02:45:37,107 --> 02:45:39,607
Barzini's dead.

1727
02:45:40,778 --> 02:45:43,278
So is Phillip Tattaglia...

1728
02:45:44,481 --> 02:45:46,960
Moe Greene...

1729
02:45:46,984 --> 02:45:49,484
Stracci...

1730
02:45:50,054 --> 02:45:52,554
Cuneo.

1731
02:45:52,623 --> 02:45:56,115
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1732
02:45:57,995 --> 02:46:00,495
Admit what you did.

1733
02:46:03,634 --> 02:46:06,134
Get him a drink.

1734
02:46:11,775 --> 02:46:14,187
Come on.

1735
02:46:14,211 --> 02:46:16,589
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1736
02:46:16,613 --> 02:46:19,113
Come on. You think I'd make my sister
a widow?

1737
02:46:20,751 --> 02:46:23,251
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1738
02:46:30,394 --> 02:46:31,705
Go ahead, drink.

1739
02:46:31,729 --> 02:46:34,229
Drink.

1740
02:46:37,301 --> 02:46:39,446
Now, Carlo, you're out
of the family business.

1741
02:46:39,470 --> 02:46:43,133
That's your punishment.
You're finished.

1742
02:46:43,240 --> 02:46:45,740
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1743
02:46:51,982 --> 02:46:55,383
I want you to stay there.
Understand?

1744
02:46:55,486 --> 02:46:57,986
Only don't tell me
you're innocent...

1745
02:46:59,556 --> 02:47:02,525
because it insults my intelligence.

1746
02:47:02,626 --> 02:47:05,126
It makes me very angry.

1747
02:47:08,031 --> 02:47:11,262
Now, who approached you?

1748
02:47:11,368 --> 02:47:13,868
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1749
02:47:21,011 --> 02:47:23,511
It was Barzini.

1750
02:47:25,949 --> 02:47:28,449
Good.

1751
02:47:35,092 --> 02:47:37,754
There's a car waiting for you
outside to take you to the airport.

1752
02:47:39,196 --> 02:47:41,696
I'll call your wife,
tell her what flight you're on.

1753
02:47:47,304 --> 02:47:49,804
- Please, can I...
- Get out of my sight.

1754
02:48:15,265 --> 02:48:17,765
Hello, Carlo.

1755
02:49:14,291 --> 02:49:17,089
Will you stop crying?
What are you trying to tell me?

1756
02:49:17,194 --> 02:49:19,992
- I'm trying to tell you you're wrong.
- Mama, please!

1757
02:49:28,407 --> 02:49:30,407
Michael! Michael!

1758
02:49:30,908 --> 02:49:33,408
Where is he?

1759
02:49:35,312 --> 02:49:40,340
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband!

1760
02:49:40,450 --> 02:49:43,044
You waited until Papa died
so nobody could stop you...

1761
02:49:43,153 --> 02:49:44,664
and then you killed him!

1762
02:49:44,688 --> 02:49:47,816
You blamed him for Sonny.
You always did. Everybody did.

1763
02:49:47,925 --> 02:49:51,554
But you never thought about me!
You never gave a damn about me!

1764
02:49:51,662 --> 02:49:54,162
Now what am I gonna do?

1765
02:49:57,868 --> 02:50:00,368
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the mall?

1766
02:50:00,437 --> 02:50:02,997
All the time he knew
he was gonna kill him.

1767
02:50:03,106 --> 02:50:06,200
And you stood godfather
to our baby.

1768
02:50:06,310 --> 02:50:08,621
You lousy, coldhearted bastard.

1769
02:50:08,645 --> 02:50:11,145
Want to know how many men
he had killed with Carlo?

1770
02:50:11,181 --> 02:50:12,926
Read the papers!
Read the papers!

1771
02:50:12,950 --> 02:50:15,450
That's your husband!
That's your husband!

1772
02:50:29,032 --> 02:50:31,532
Take her upstairs.

1773
02:50:31,568 --> 02:50:34,068
- Get her a doctor.
- Oh, God!

1774
02:50:54,124 --> 02:50:56,624
She's hysterical.

1775
02:51:00,564 --> 02:51:03,064
Hysterical.

1776
02:51:04,067 --> 02:51:06,567
Michael, is it true?

1777
02:51:08,005 --> 02:51:10,049
Don't ask me about my business, Kay.

1778
02:51:10,073 --> 02:51:13,565
- Is it true?
- Don't ask me about my business.

1779
02:51:13,677 --> 02:51:16,177
- No.
- Enough!

1780
02:51:34,564 --> 02:51:37,064
All right.

1781
02:51:38,869 --> 02:51:41,369
This one time.

1782
02:51:44,574 --> 02:51:47,074
This one time, I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1783
02:51:53,617 --> 02:51:56,117
Is it true?

1784
02:51:59,723 --> 02:52:02,223
Is it?

1785
02:52:02,524 --> 02:52:04,024
No.

1786
02:52:17,741 --> 02:52:20,119
I guess we both need a drink, huh?

1787
02:52:20,143 --> 02:52:22,643
Come on.

1788
02:52:52,209 --> 02:52:54,709
Don Corleone.
