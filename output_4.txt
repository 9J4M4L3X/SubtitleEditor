1
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,320
I believe in America.

2
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,190
America has made my fortune

3
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,293
and I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:30,728
I gave her freedom,
but I taught her

5
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,333
never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:37,434
She found a boyfriend.
Not an Italian.

7
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,852
She went to the movies with him.

8
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:42,970
She stayed out late.
I didn't protest.

9
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:47,580
Two months ago,
he took her for a drive

10
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:50,183
with another boyfriend.

11
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,148
They made her drink whiskey,

12
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:56,453
and then they tried
to take advantage of her.

13
00:01:57,693 --> 00:01:59,838
She resisted.

14
00:01:59,862 --> 00:02:02,362
She kept her honor.

15
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:06,125
So they beat her like an animal.

16
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:11,768
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken...

17
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:15,187
her jaw was shattered...

18
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:17,711
held together by wire.

19
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:22,309
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

20
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:28,646
But I wept. Why did I weep?

21
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:33,827
She was the light of my life.

22
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:38,198
Beautiful girl.

23
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,670
Now she will never
be beautiful again.

24
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:53,313
Sorry.

25
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:03,957
I, I went to the police,
like a good American.

26
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:07,527
These two boys
were brought to trial.

27
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:11,595
A judge sentence them
to three years in prison...

28
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:14,201
and suspend their sentence.

29
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:17,504
Suspended the sentence.

30
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,073
They went free that very day.

31
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,745
I stood in the courtroom
like a fool.

32
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:28,880
And those two bastard,
they smiled at me.

33
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:33,889
Then I said to my wife,
"For justice...

34
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,490
we must go to Don Corleone."

35
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:44,696
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

36
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:47,679
What do you want of me?

37
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:50,797
Tell me anything,
but do what I beg you to do.

38
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:54,508
What is that?

39
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,901
That I cannot do.

40
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:23,904
I'll give you anything you ask.

41
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:29,073
We've known each other many years,
but this is the first time...

42
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:32,511
you ever came to me
for counsel or for help.

43
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:35,550
I can't remember the last time
that you invited me...

44
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,151
to your house
for a cup of coffee...

45
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:42,885
even though my wife
is godmother to your only child.

46
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:45,237
But let's be frank.

47
00:04:45,261 --> 00:04:47,761
You never wanted my friendship...

48
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:51,893
and you were afraid
to be in my debt.

49
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,501
I didn't want
to get into trouble.

50
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:58,105
I understand.

51
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,007
You found paradise in America.

52
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:05,791
You had a good trade,
you made a good living.

53
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:08,511
Police protected you,
and there were courts of law.

54
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:11,118
So you didn't need
a friend like me.

55
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:16,516
But, now you come to me
and you say,

56
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:19,126
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

57
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,730
But you don't ask with respect.

58
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,393
You don't offer friendship.

59
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:29,002
You don't even think
to call me 'Godfather.'

60
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:31,917
Instead, you come into my house

61
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:33,919
on the day my daughter
is to be married

62
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:36,443
and you ask me to do murder
for money.

63
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
I ask you for justice.

64
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,679
That is not justice.
Your daughter is still alive.

65
00:05:43,986 --> 00:05:47,353
They must suffer then
as she suffers.

66
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:51,925
How much shall I pay you?

67
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:08,975
Bonasera. Bonasera.

68
00:06:10,513 --> 00:06:13,880
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

69
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:18,245
If you'd come to me
in friendship,

70
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:20,332
then the scum
that ruined your daughter

71
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:22,856
would be suffering
this very day.

72
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:25,070
And if, by chance,

73
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,139
an honest man like yourself
should make enemies,

74
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:29,663
then they would become
my enemies.

75
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,267
And then they would fear you.

76
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:40,841
Be my friend?

77
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,780
Godfather.

78
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:52,853
Good.

79
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:55,867
Someday, and that day
may never come...

80
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:58,391
I'll call upon you
to do a service for me.

81
00:07:00,196 --> 00:07:02,696
But until that day...

82
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,958
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

83
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:10,937
<i>- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego</i>

84
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,480
Give this to Clemenza.

85
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,396
I want reliable people,

86
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,598
people that aren't
going to be carried away.

87
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:28,133
I mean, we're not murderers,

88
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,717
in spite of what
this undertaker says.

89
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:57,696
- Where's Michael?
- What? Don't worry.

90
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,464
It's early. He'll be here.

91
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:00,699
We're not taking it.

92
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:03,223
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

93
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:05,724
<i>No picture now.</i>

94
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,098
- What's the matter, Sonny?
- It's Michael.

95
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:04,617
Don Barzini.

96
00:09:07,118 --> 00:09:09,118
<i>Welcome to our house.</i>

97
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:23,464
Hey, Paulie!
Let me have some wine.

98
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:26,132
Paulie! More wine.

99
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:27,486
<i>Scusi, please.</i>

100
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,321
You look terrif on the floor.

101
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:31,845
What are you,
a dance judge or something?

102
00:09:32,848 --> 00:09:35,348
Go take a walk around
the neighborhood. Do your job.

103
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,870
Hey, Sandra, come on. Do me a favor.
Watch the kids.

104
00:09:44,894 --> 00:09:47,854
- Don't let 'em run wild, all right?
- Well, you watch yourself, all right?

105
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,297
Twenty or thirty grand.

106
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,821
In small bills, cash.

107
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,657
In that little silk purse.

108
00:10:18,093 --> 00:10:20,593
If this was
somebody else's wedding.

109
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:24,061
<i>Hey, Paulie!
I got two gobbagool...</i>

110
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,011
<i>gabagol and a prosciutto.</i>

111
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:28,535
Stupid jerk!

112
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:39,245
Hey, what's the matter?

113
00:10:50,826 --> 00:10:53,204
- I have to go back to work.
- Oh, Tom.

114
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:54,539
It's part of the wedding.

115
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:57,464
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

116
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:05,817
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

117
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:08,341
that you have invited me
to your home...

118
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:14,192
Get outta here.

119
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,716
This is a private party. Go on.

120
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:20,153
What is it?
Hey, my sister's wedding.

121
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,729
Goddamn FBI
don't respect nothin'.

122
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,700
Hey, come here, come here.
Come here!

123
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,572
There.

124
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:52,564
But towards the end
he was paroled...

125
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,216
to help with
the American war effort.

126
00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:57,824
For the last six months, he's been
working at my pastry shop.

127
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,572
Nazorine, my friend,
what can I do for you?

128
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,096
Now that the war is over...

129
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:06,225
this boy, Enzo, they want
to repatriate him back to Italy.

130
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:09,896
Godfather, I have a daughter.

131
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:12,505
See, she and Enzo...

132
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,487
You want Enzo to stay
in this country...

133
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:18,011
and you want your daughter
to be married.

134
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:21,581
You understand everything.

135
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,784
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

136
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:29,334
And wait till you see
the beautiful wedding cake...

137
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:30,769
I made for your daughter.

138
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,353
Like this, with the bride
and the groom and...

139
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:42,695
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

140
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:47,000
Give it to a Jew congressman
in another district.

141
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,643
Who else is on the list?

142
00:12:56,785 --> 00:12:58,963
Hey, Michael. How are you?

143
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,487
Hello.

144
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,903
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

145
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,661
Is this... Is this necessary?

146
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,596
He didn't expect to be invited
to the wedding...

147
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,665
so he wanted to thank you.

148
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,366
All right.

149
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,621
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

150
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:41,227
that you have invited me
to your home...

151
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,830
on the wedding day
of your daughter.

152
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:46,733
And may their first child
be a masculine child.

153
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:49,360
- Don...
- Michael?

154
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:51,015
Don Corleone...

155
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,539
That man over there
is talking to himself.

156
00:13:54,443 --> 00:13:56,943
See that scary guy over there?

157
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,757
He's a very scary guy.

158
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:01,092
Who is he? What's his name?

159
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:03,710
His name is Luca Brasi...

160
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:06,319
and he helps my father out
sometimes.

161
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:09,595
Oh, Michael, wait a minute.
He's coming over here.

162
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:10,596
Mike!

163
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,097
Ho! Tom.

164
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:13,621
Heyyy!

165
00:14:14,797 --> 00:14:16,674
You look terrific!

166
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:18,877
My brother Tom Hagen.
This is Kay Adams.

167
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,426
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

168
00:14:21,537 --> 00:14:23,882
Your father's
been asking for you.

169
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,626
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

170
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,150
I'll be there.

171
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,206
If he's your brother,
why does he have a different name?

172
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,292
Oh, uh, when my brother Sonny was a kid...

173
00:14:34,316 --> 00:14:36,816
he found Tom Hagen in the street,
and he had no home.

174
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:40,219
And so my father took him in...

175
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:43,289
and he's been with us ever since.

176
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:46,492
He's a good lawyer.

177
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,274
Not a Sicilian, but...

178
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:51,609
I think he's gonna be consigliere.

179
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:54,133
- What's that?
- That's...

180
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:56,381
like a counselor, an advisor.

181
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:58,905
Very important to the family.

182
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:01,974
You like your lasagne?

183
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:10,885
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

184
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:14,217
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding...

185
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:22,328
on the day
of your daughter's wedding.

186
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:26,098
And I hope
that their first child...

187
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:28,701
be a masculine child.

188
00:15:29,538 --> 00:15:34,566
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

189
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:38,423
For your daughter's
bridal purse.

190
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:41,439
Thank you, Luca,
my most valued friend.

191
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,008
Don Corleone,
I'm gonna leave you now...

192
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,165
because I know you are busy.

193
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:49,689
Thank you.

194
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:56,179
Senator Cauly apologized
for not coming personally...

195
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,784
but said you'd understand.

196
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,621
Also some of the judges.

197
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,624
They've all sent gifts.

198
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,961
What is that outside?

199
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:19,600
Johnny!

200
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:25,044
I love you.

201
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,747
Hey, Johnny, look over here!

202
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,585
He came all the way from California
to come to the wedding.

203
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:38,931
- I told you he was going to come.
- It's been two years.

204
00:18:38,955 --> 00:18:41,455
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

205
00:18:45,534 --> 00:18:48,034
Sing a song.

206
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:05,084
Michael, you never told me
you knew Johnny Fontane.

207
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:09,146
- Sure. You wanna meet him?
- Huh? Oh, well, sure.

208
00:19:09,257 --> 00:19:11,302
My father helped him
with his career.

209
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:14,420
- For my Connie.
- He did? How?

210
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,274
<i>I have but one</i>

211
00:19:16,298 --> 00:19:18,232
- Let's listen to the song.
- No, Michael

212
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,844
<i>Heart</i>

213
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:23,565
<i>This heart I bring you</i>

214
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:29,507
<i>I have but one heart</i>

215
00:19:29,611 --> 00:19:32,111
<i>To share with you</i>

216
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,849
<i>I have but one dream</i>

217
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:42,549
<i>That I can cling to</i>

218
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:48,724
<i>You are the one dream</i>

219
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,095
<i>I pray comes true</i>

220
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:55,213
Please, Michael. Tell me.

221
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:58,900
<i>My darling, until I saw you</i>

222
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:00,985
Well, when Johnny was first starting out...

223
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:03,876
he was signed to this
personal service contract...

224
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:06,479
with a big bandleader.

225
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,960
And as his career
got better and better...

226
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:11,484
he wanted to get out of it.

227
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:14,883
Now, Johnny is
my father's godson...

228
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,490
and my father went
to see this bandleader...

229
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,926
and he offered him
$10,000 to let Johnny go.

230
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:24,897
But the bandleader said no.

231
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,360
So the next day
my father went to see him...

232
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,970
only this time with Luca Brasi.

233
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:35,701
And within an hour,
he signed a release...

234
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:40,474
for a certified check of $1,000.

235
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,327
How'd he do that?

236
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:45,876
My father made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

237
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:49,822
What was that?

238
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,654
Luca Brasi
held a gun to his head...

239
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:55,006
and my father assured him
that either his brains...

240
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,530
or his signature
would be on the contract.

241
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:05,604
That's a true story.

242
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,484
That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.

243
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,833
Beautiful!

244
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:44,121
My godson comes all the way
from California.

245
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:46,645
Give him a glass of wine.

246
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,867
I'll take care of it.

247
00:22:09,437 --> 00:22:12,338
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

248
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,882
How are you, Fredo?

249
00:22:23,518 --> 00:22:26,018
My brother Fredo.
This is Kay Adams.

250
00:22:27,122 --> 00:22:29,622
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

251
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,590
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

252
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:37,196
Yeah. This is your friend, huh?

253
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:42,597
I don't know what to do.
My voice is, is weak.

254
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:45,016
It's weak.

255
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,668
Anyway, if I had this part
in the picture, you know...

256
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:50,404
it puts me right back
up on top again.

257
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:54,013
But this, uh...

258
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:56,260
this man out there,
he won't give it to me.

259
00:22:56,284 --> 00:22:58,329
- The head of the studio.
- What's his name?

260
00:22:58,353 --> 00:23:00,947
Woltz. Woltz.
He won't give it to me...

261
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:04,617
and he says
there's no chance, no chance.

262
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,130
Sonny?

263
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:12,831
Sonny?

264
00:23:19,373 --> 00:23:20,373
Sonny?

265
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,102
Sonny, you in there?

266
00:23:23,344 --> 00:23:25,844
- What?
- The old man wants to see you.

267
00:23:27,315 --> 00:23:29,815
All right, one minute.

268
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:46,557
A month ago, he bought
the movie rights to this book.

269
00:23:46,668 --> 00:23:48,479
A best-seller.

270
00:23:48,503 --> 00:23:50,781
And the main character
is a guy just like me.

271
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,305
Why, I wouldn't even
have to act.

272
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:54,785
Just be myself.

273
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,677
Oh, Godfather, I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

274
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:03,017
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

275
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,830
Is this how you turned out?

276
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:08,482
A Hollywood finocchio
that cries like a woman?

277
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,470
"What can I do?"
"What can I do?"

278
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,038
What is that nonsense?

279
00:24:14,062 --> 00:24:16,562
Ridiculous!

280
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:23,834
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

281
00:24:23,938 --> 00:24:25,483
Good.

282
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:27,747
Because the man who doesn't
spend time with his family...

283
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:29,920
can never be a real man.

284
00:24:29,944 --> 00:24:32,444
Come here.

285
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:38,417
You look terrible.
I want you to eat.

286
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,632
I want you to rest well,
and a month from now...

287
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:44,784
this Hollywood big shot's
gonna give you what you want.

288
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:47,393
Too late.
They start shooting in a week.

289
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:50,663
I'm gonna make him an offer
he can't refuse.

290
00:24:54,102 --> 00:24:56,147
Now just go outside,
enjoy yourself and...

291
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:58,765
forget about all this nonsense.

292
00:25:00,275 --> 00:25:02,869
Listen. I want you
to leave it all to me.

293
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:06,312
All right.

294
00:25:29,537 --> 00:25:32,301
What time does my daughter
leave with the bridegroom?

295
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,885
In a few minutes,
right after they cut the cake.

296
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:38,106
Now, your new son-in-law,
we give him something important.

297
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:40,558
Never. Give him a living...

298
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,608
but never discuss
the family business with him.

299
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:45,095
What else?

300
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,697
Virgil Sollozzo called.

301
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:49,099
We have to give him a day
sometime next week.

302
00:25:49,123 --> 00:25:51,623
We'll discuss him when you
come back from California.

303
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,971
When am I going to California?

304
00:25:53,995 --> 00:25:56,073
I want you to go tonight.

305
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:58,895
I want you to talk
to this movie big shot...

306
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,500
and settle this business
for Johnny.

307
00:26:02,537 --> 00:26:05,438
Now if there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

308
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,310
Carlo, we're gonna take
the picture.

309
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,758
Wait a minute.

310
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,282
No, Michael, not me.

311
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:21,499
Just a little closer.

312
00:26:21,523 --> 00:26:24,023
Okay, that's it.
Just like that now. Hold it.

313
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:11,363
Isn't that nice?

314
00:28:16,337 --> 00:28:18,048
All right, start talking.

315
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,572
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

316
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,038
This friend is my client and would
give his undying friendship...

317
00:28:24,145 --> 00:28:27,876
to Mr. Woltz, if Mr. Woltz
would grant us a small favor.

318
00:28:27,982 --> 00:28:30,461
Woltz is listening.

319
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:33,579
Give Johnny the part in that new
war film you're starting next week.

320
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:43,253
And what favor
would your friend...

321
00:28:43,364 --> 00:28:45,242
grant Mr. Woltz?

322
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,144
You're gonna have
some union problems.

323
00:28:47,168 --> 00:28:48,979
My client could make them disappear.

324
00:28:49,003 --> 00:28:51,115
Also, one of your top stars
has just moved...

325
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:53,117
from marijuana to heroin.

326
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:55,119
- Are you trying to muscle me?
- Absolutely not.

327
00:28:55,143 --> 00:28:57,521
Now listen to me,
you smooth-talking son of a bitch!

328
00:28:57,545 --> 00:29:00,207
Let me lay it on the line for you
and your boss, whoever he is!

329
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:01,925
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie.

330
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,428
I don't care
how many dago, guinea, wop...

331
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,797
greaseball goombahs
come outta the woodwork.

332
00:29:06,821 --> 00:29:08,065
I'm German-Irish.

333
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:10,683
Well, let me tell you something,
my kraut mick friend.

334
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:13,693
I'm going to make so much trouble for you,
you won't know what hit you.

335
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,773
Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer.
I have not threatened...

336
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,698
I know almost every big lawyer
in New York. Who the hell are you?

337
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,031
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

338
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,636
Now, you have my number.
I'll wait for your call.

339
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,540
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.

340
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,981
Check him out.

341
00:29:57,805 --> 00:30:00,305
- This is really beautiful.
- Look at this.

342
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:02,586
It used to decorate
the palace of a king.

343
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,888
Oh, yeah. Very nice.

344
00:30:04,912 --> 00:30:07,540
Why didn't you say
you worked for Corleone, Tom?

345
00:30:07,648 --> 00:30:09,893
I thought you were just
some cheap, two-bit hustler...

346
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:11,962
Johnny was running in,
trying to bluff me.

347
00:30:11,986 --> 00:30:14,465
I don't like to use his name
unless it's really necessary.

348
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:16,066
- How's your drink, Tom?
- Fine.

349
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,170
Hey, come on over here with me. I want to
show you something really beautiful.

350
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:21,694
You do appreciate beauty,
don't you, Tom?

351
00:30:24,465 --> 00:30:27,491
There you are.
$600,000 on four hooves.

352
00:30:27,602 --> 00:30:28,912
I'll bet Russian czars...

353
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:31,248
never paid that kind of dough
for a single horse.

354
00:30:31,272 --> 00:30:33,772
Khartoum.

355
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:40,603
I'm not gonna race him, though.
I'm gonna put him out to stud.

356
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,259
Beautiful.

357
00:30:42,283 --> 00:30:43,927
- Thanks, Tony.
- You're welcome.

358
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:46,451
- Come on.
- Let's get something to eat.

359
00:30:47,922 --> 00:30:50,422
Mr. Corleone
is Johnny's godfather.

360
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,737
To the Italian people,
that's a very religious...

361
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:55,739
sacred, close relationship.

362
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:56,874
I respect that.

363
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:59,398
Just tell him he should ask me
anything else.

364
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,000
But this is one favor
I can't give him.

365
00:31:02,303 --> 00:31:04,803
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

366
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:07,864
- Understood?
- You don't understand.

367
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:10,475
Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

368
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:15,576
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

369
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:17,661
I'm gonna run him
out of the business.

370
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:20,185
And let me tell you why.

371
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:24,551
Johnny Fontane ruined
one of Woltz International's...

372
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:26,637
most valuable protégés.

373
00:31:26,661 --> 00:31:28,972
For five years,
we had her under training.

374
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:32,056
Singing lessons,
acting lessons, dancing lessons.

375
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:34,545
I spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars on her.

376
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:36,847
I was gonna make her a big star.

377
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:39,601
And let me be even more frank.

378
00:31:39,707 --> 00:31:42,085
Just to show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man...

379
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,634
that it's not all dollars and cents.

380
00:31:44,745 --> 00:31:46,545
She was beautiful!

381
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:48,758
She was young, she was innocent!

382
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,761
She was the greatest piece of ass
I've ever had...

383
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:53,285
and I've had 'em all over the world!

384
00:31:53,988 --> 00:31:56,133
And then Johnny Fontane comes along...

385
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:59,058
with his olive oil voice and guinea charm.

386
00:32:00,361 --> 00:32:02,861
And she runs off.

387
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:06,223
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous...

388
00:32:07,435 --> 00:32:09,847
and a man in my position can't afford...

389
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:12,635
to be made to look ridiculous!

390
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,118
Now you get the hell outta here!

391
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,254
And if that goombah
tries any rough stuff...

392
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:19,778
you tell him I ain't no bandleader.

393
00:32:21,048 --> 00:32:23,676
Yeah. I heard that story.

394
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:27,285
Thank you for the dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

395
00:32:28,723 --> 00:32:31,317
If your car could take me
to the airport...

396
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:35,225
Mr. Corleone is a man who insists
on hearing bad news immediately.

397
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:31,872
- You're not too tired are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

398
00:34:31,979 --> 00:34:34,479
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

399
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,616
Now...

400
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:40,919
Sollozzo is known as "The Turk."

401
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:43,934
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife...

402
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,736
<i>but only
in matters of business...</i>

403
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,260
<i>with some sort
of reasonable complaint.</i>

404
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,590
<i>His business is narcotics.</i>

405
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:55,032
<i>He has fields in Turkey
where they grow the poppy...</i>

406
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:58,037
<i>and in Sicily he has the plants
to process them into heroin.</i>

407
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,707
<i>Now, he needs cash and he needs
protection from the police...</i>

408
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,888
<i>for which he gives
a piece of the action.</i>

409
00:35:04,912 --> 00:35:06,890
<i>I couldn't find out how much.</i>

410
00:35:06,914 --> 00:35:09,712
<i>The Tattaglia family
is behind him here in New York.</i>

411
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:11,962
<i>Now, they have to be
in it for something.</i>

412
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:13,096
Santino Corleone.

413
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,965
What about his prison record?

414
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:17,489
Two terms,
one in Italy, one here.

415
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:20,537
He's known as
a top narcotics man.

416
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:23,061
Santino, what do you think?

417
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,665
There's a lot of money
in that white powder.

418
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:29,279
Tom?

419
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:31,803
<i>Well, I say, yes, there's more
money potential in narcotics...</i>

420
00:35:31,872 --> 00:35:33,850
<i>than anything else
we're looking at.</i>

421
00:35:33,874 --> 00:35:36,286
<i>Now, if we don't get into it,
somebody else will.</i>

422
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,422
<i>Maybe one of the five families,
maybe all of them.</i>

423
00:35:38,446 --> 00:35:39,726
<i>Now, with the money they earn...</i>

424
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,980
they can buy more police
and political power.

425
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:45,262
Then they come after us.

426
00:35:45,286 --> 00:35:48,050
Now we have the unions,
we have the gambling...

427
00:35:48,155 --> 00:35:50,434
and they're the best things
to have, but narcotics...

428
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:51,935
is a thing of the future.

429
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,770
Now, if we don't get
a piece of that action...

430
00:35:53,794 --> 00:35:55,272
we risk everything we have.

431
00:35:55,296 --> 00:35:57,796
I mean, not now,
but ten years from now.

432
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:04,429
So? What's your answer
gonna be, Pop?

433
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,680
I need a man
who has powerful friends.

434
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:19,280
I need a million dollars in cash.

435
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,465
I need, Don Corleone,
those politicians...

436
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:25,152
that you carry in your pocket
like so many nickels and dimes.

437
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:28,839
What is the interest
for my family?

438
00:36:28,863 --> 00:36:30,774
Thirty percent.

439
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:33,596
In the first year, your end
should be three, four million dollars.

440
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:37,402
And then it would go up.

441
00:36:38,005 --> 00:36:40,505
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

442
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:46,011
My compliments.

443
00:36:48,816 --> 00:36:51,444
I'll take care of the Tattaglias.
Outta my share.

444
00:36:52,453 --> 00:36:55,149
So, I receive 30% for finance...

445
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,735
political influence
and legal protection.

446
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,259
- That's what you're telling me.
- That's right.

447
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:07,066
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

448
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:10,103
If you consider
a million dollars in cash...

449
00:37:10,204 --> 00:37:12,381
just "finance"...

450
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:14,405
<i>I salute you, Don Corleone.</i>

451
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:28,187
I said that I would see you because...

452
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:30,467
I heard that you were
a serious man...

453
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:32,991
to be treated with respect.

454
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,828
But I must say no to you.

455
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:44,447
And I'll give you my reason.

456
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,269
It's true, I have
a lot of friends in politics.

457
00:37:48,943 --> 00:37:50,921
But they wouldn't be friendly
very long...

458
00:37:50,945 --> 00:37:53,290
if they knew my business was drugs
instead of gambling...

459
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:56,511
which they regard
as a harmless vice.

460
00:37:56,617 --> 00:37:59,245
- But drugs is a dirty business.
- No, Don Corleone...

461
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:01,331
It doesn't make
any difference to me...

462
00:38:01,355 --> 00:38:04,119
what a man does for a living,
you understand...

463
00:38:04,225 --> 00:38:06,725
but your business is...

464
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:09,506
a little dangerous.

465
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,008
If you're worried about security
for your million...

466
00:38:12,032 --> 00:38:13,710
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

467
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:16,464
You're tellin' me the Tattaglias
guarantee our investment...

468
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,070
Wait a minute.

469
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:27,123
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children...

470
00:38:27,147 --> 00:38:29,459
and I spoil them,
as you can see.

471
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:31,161
They talk when they should listen.

472
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:33,296
But anyway...

473
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,820
Signor Sollozzo,
my no is final...

474
00:38:35,889 --> 00:38:38,687
and I wish to congratulate you
on your new business.

475
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:42,057
I know you'll do very well,
and good luck to you...

476
00:38:42,162 --> 00:38:45,131
especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine.

477
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:49,067
Thank you.

478
00:39:09,523 --> 00:39:12,023
Come here.

479
00:39:13,794 --> 00:39:15,605
What's the matter with you?

480
00:39:15,629 --> 00:39:17,407
I think your brain
is going soft...

481
00:39:17,431 --> 00:39:20,298
from all that comedy you're
playing with that young girl.

482
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:23,802
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

483
00:39:25,973 --> 00:39:28,473
Go on.

484
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:33,941
Tom, what?
What is this nonsense?

485
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:36,548
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

486
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:41,064
Well, take it away.

487
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:43,588
Take it over there.

488
00:39:43,857 --> 00:39:46,303
And...

489
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:48,827
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

490
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:57,831
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

491
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:01,305
I want you to find out what he's got
under his fingernails, you know?

492
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:04,187
Go to the Tattaglias...

493
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:06,523
and make them think...

494
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:10,244
that you're not too happy
with our family...

495
00:40:11,352 --> 00:40:13,852
and find out what you can.

496
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:34,630
And I got something
for your mother and for Sonny...

497
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:36,786
and a tie for Freddy...

498
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,506
and Tom Hagen
got the Reynolds pen.

499
00:40:39,613 --> 00:40:41,691
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Me?

500
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:44,215
Oh, just you.

501
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,528
Tell Paulie to get the car.
We're going.

502
00:41:18,552 --> 00:41:19,963
Okay, Pa.

503
00:41:19,987 --> 00:41:22,888
I'll have to get it myself, Pa.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

504
00:41:25,893 --> 00:41:28,393
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind gettin' the car.

505
00:42:17,444 --> 00:42:20,902
Luca, I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

506
00:42:21,014 --> 00:42:22,459
I know.

507
00:42:22,483 --> 00:42:24,983
Scotch? Prewar.

508
00:42:31,158 --> 00:42:32,658
You know who I am?

509
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,090
I know you.

510
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,970
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

511
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:43,970
I think you and I can do business.

512
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,480
I need someone strong like you.

513
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,940
I heard you are not happy...

514
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,650
...with the Corleone family.

515
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,150
Want to join me?

516
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,280
What's in it for me?

517
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,830
$50,000 to start with.

518
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,080
Not bad!

519
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,380
Agreed?

520
00:44:11,793 --> 00:44:13,770
Oh. Tom Hagen.

521
00:44:13,794 --> 00:44:15,572
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

522
00:44:15,596 --> 00:44:18,531
I'm glad I run into you.
I wanna talk to you.

523
00:44:18,632 --> 00:44:20,510
I haven't got time.

524
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:23,298
Oh, make time, consigliere.
Get in the car.

525
00:44:25,405 --> 00:44:26,983
What are you worried about?

526
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,507
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

527
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,810
Get in.

528
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:44,791
<i>Wait a moment, Fredo.</i>

529
00:44:44,992 --> 00:44:47,492
- I'm gonna buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pa.

530
00:44:52,633 --> 00:44:54,510
Hi. Merry Christmas.

531
00:44:54,534 --> 00:44:57,034
I want some fruit over there.

532
00:44:59,773 --> 00:45:02,273
Gimme three of them.

533
00:45:03,377 --> 00:45:05,877
No, that one.

534
00:45:23,997 --> 00:45:26,497
Fredo!

535
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:15,646
Papa.

536
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:18,182
Papa!

537
00:46:23,023 --> 00:46:25,787
Mike, would you like me better
if I were a nun...

538
00:46:25,892 --> 00:46:28,392
like in the story, you know?

539
00:46:30,631 --> 00:46:31,631
No.

540
00:46:31,732 --> 00:46:34,633
Well, then would you like me better
if I were Ingrid Bergman?

541
00:46:34,735 --> 00:46:37,235
Now that's a thought.

542
00:46:38,606 --> 00:46:39,606
Michael.

543
00:46:40,307 --> 00:46:43,538
No, I would not like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

544
00:46:43,643 --> 00:46:46,143
- Michael.
- What's the matter?

545
00:47:01,928 --> 00:47:04,428
They don't say
if he's dead or alive.

546
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,525
Sonny, Michael.

547
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:29,949
<i>Michael, where you been?</i>

548
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,701
Is he all right?

549
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:34,455
<i>We don't know yet.
There's all kinds of stories.</i>

550
00:47:35,996 --> 00:47:38,496
<i>He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>

551
00:47:38,932 --> 00:47:42,060
<i>- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.</i>

552
00:47:42,169 --> 00:47:44,580
<i>Where you been? I was worried.</i>

553
00:47:44,604 --> 00:47:46,749
Didn't Tom tell you? I called.

554
00:47:46,773 --> 00:47:50,504
<i>No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>

555
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:53,110
All right.

556
00:47:58,819 --> 00:48:01,319
Oh, my God.

557
00:48:15,302 --> 00:48:17,802
Who is it?

558
00:48:17,904 --> 00:48:20,404
Open up. It's Clemenza.

559
00:48:21,408 --> 00:48:22,451
What?

560
00:48:22,475 --> 00:48:24,975
There's more news about your old man.

561
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,490
The word is out on the street
he's already dead.

562
00:48:27,514 --> 00:48:29,492
Shut your mouth.
What's the matter with you?

563
00:48:29,516 --> 00:48:32,016
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

564
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:34,230
- Where was Paulie?
- Paulie was out sick.

565
00:48:34,254 --> 00:48:36,774
- He's been home sick all winter.
- How many times he been sick?

566
00:48:36,823 --> 00:48:38,367
Only maybe three, four times.

567
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:40,631
I mean, I asked Freddy if he wants
a different bodyguard.

568
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:42,171
- He said no.
- Pick him up right now.

569
00:48:42,195 --> 00:48:44,006
I don't care how sick he is.

570
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,776
If he's breathin', I want you to bring him
to my father's house now. You understand? Now

571
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,598
- You want me to send people here?
- No, just you and him. Go ahead.

572
00:48:49,703 --> 00:48:52,203
All right.

573
00:48:59,212 --> 00:49:02,413
I'm havin' a couple of our people come
over to the house. A couple of our people.

574
00:49:06,019 --> 00:49:08,264
<i>- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?</i>

575
00:49:08,288 --> 00:49:10,788
<i>- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.</i>

576
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:14,894
<i>In about three hours, he'll be
released with our proposition.</i>

577
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:18,362
<i>Listen to everything he has
to say before you do anything.</i>

578
00:49:18,465 --> 00:49:20,076
<i>What's done is done.</i>

579
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,069
<i>And don't lose that famous temper
of yours, huh, Sonny?</i>

580
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,669
No, I'll wait.

581
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,685
Your boss is dead.

582
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:46,469
I know you're not in the muscle
end of the family, Tom...

583
00:49:46,493 --> 00:49:48,993
so I don't want you to be scared.

584
00:49:49,562 --> 00:49:52,087
I want you
to help the Corleones...

585
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,698
and I want you to help me.

586
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,081
Yeah. We got him outside his office...

587
00:49:59,105 --> 00:50:01,605
just about an hour after we picked you up.

588
00:50:03,443 --> 00:50:05,943
Drink it.

589
00:50:09,082 --> 00:50:12,518
So now it's up to you to make
the peace between me and Sonny.

590
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:19,557
Sonny was hot
for my deal, wasn't he?

591
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:23,461
And you knew it was
the right thing to do.

592
00:50:25,298 --> 00:50:27,798
Sonny will come after you
with everything he's got.

593
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:31,068
That'll be his first reaction, sure.

594
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:34,216
That's why you gotta
talk some sense into him.

595
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,471
The Tattaglia family is behind me
with all their people.

596
00:50:38,445 --> 00:50:40,726
The other New York families
will go along with anything...

597
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:43,250
that will prevent a full-scale war.

598
00:50:43,683 --> 00:50:46,028
Let's face it, Tom,
in all due respect...

599
00:50:46,052 --> 00:50:48,612
the Don, rest in peace, was slippin'.

600
00:50:51,524 --> 00:50:54,024
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

601
00:50:58,498 --> 00:51:00,042
Well, now he's dead.

602
00:51:00,066 --> 00:51:02,566
He's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

603
00:51:04,204 --> 00:51:06,315
So you gotta talk to Sonny.

604
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:08,250
You gotta talk
to the caporegimes...

605
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,774
that Tessio, and that fat Clemenza.

606
00:51:15,181 --> 00:51:17,681
It's good business, Tom.

607
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:20,896
I'll try.

608
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,582
But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

609
00:51:26,593 --> 00:51:29,093
Yeah. Well...

610
00:51:29,896 --> 00:51:32,396
Let me worry about Luca.

611
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:39,682
You just talk to Sonny.

612
00:51:39,706 --> 00:51:42,206
And the other two kids.

613
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:46,922
I'll do my best.

614
00:51:46,946 --> 00:51:49,446
Good.

615
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,750
Now, you can go.

616
00:51:59,626 --> 00:52:02,959
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

617
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:06,997
Blood is a big expense.

618
00:52:28,088 --> 00:52:29,965
He's still alive.

619
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:32,489
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

620
00:52:33,993 --> 00:52:35,971
Well, that's bad luck for me...

621
00:52:35,995 --> 00:52:38,495
and bad luck for you
if you don't make that deal.

622
00:53:23,476 --> 00:53:25,521
Your mother's over
in the hospital with your father.

623
00:53:25,545 --> 00:53:28,045
Looks like he's gonna
pull through, thank God.

624
00:53:30,116 --> 00:53:32,361
- That's a lot of bad blood.
- What do you think?

625
00:53:32,385 --> 00:53:35,252
It's too far.
I think it's too personal.

626
00:53:35,355 --> 00:53:38,017
- The Don will consider this over.
- You gonna kill all those guys?

627
00:53:38,124 --> 00:53:40,764
- Hey, stay out of it, Mickey, do me a favor.
- Sollozzo's the key.

628
00:53:40,788 --> 00:53:42,905
You get rid of him,
everything falls into line.

629
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:45,523
What about Luca? Sollozzo
didn't seem worried about Luca.

630
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:50,999
I don't know. If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

631
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:53,149
Has anyone been able
to get in touch with Luca?

632
00:53:53,173 --> 00:53:55,251
We've been tryin' all night.
He might be shacked up.

633
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,318
Hey, Mick, try him again.

634
00:53:56,342 --> 00:53:57,987
Luca never sleeps over
with a broad.

635
00:53:58,011 --> 00:54:00,511
He always goes home
when he's through.

636
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:04,016
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.

637
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:07,245
What do we do
if the old man dies, God forbid?

638
00:54:07,353 --> 00:54:09,853
If we lose the old man...

639
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:13,558
we lose our political contacts
and half our strength.

640
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,561
The other New York families might
wind up supporting Sollozzo...

641
00:54:16,663 --> 00:54:19,008
just to avoid a long destructive war.

642
00:54:19,032 --> 00:54:22,763
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

643
00:54:24,003 --> 00:54:26,503
If your father dies...

644
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,585
you'll make the deal, Sonny.

645
00:54:29,609 --> 00:54:32,169
You know, that's easy for you to say,
Tom. He's not your father.

646
00:54:32,278 --> 00:54:34,778
I was as much a son to him
as you or Mike.

647
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:41,697
What is it?

648
00:54:41,721 --> 00:54:44,166
Hey, Paulie, I thought
I told you to stay put.

649
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,818
Well, the guy at the gates,
they say they got a package.

650
00:54:46,926 --> 00:54:49,426
Yeah? Tessio, go see what it is.

651
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,777
- You want me to hang around?
- Yeah, hang around.

652
00:54:54,801 --> 00:54:56,278
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

653
00:54:56,302 --> 00:54:58,998
Yeah? There's some food
in the icebox. You hungry or anything?

654
00:54:59,105 --> 00:55:01,150
- No, it's all right. Thanks.
- How 'bout a drink? How 'bout a little brandy?

655
00:55:01,174 --> 00:55:03,094
- That's good to sweat it out.
- All right, sure.

656
00:55:03,118 --> 00:55:05,618
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

657
00:55:07,146 --> 00:55:09,646
I want you to take care
of that son of a bitch right away.

658
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:12,207
Paulie sold out the old man, that strutz.

659
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:15,412
I don't wanna see him again. Make that
first thing on your list, understand?

660
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:16,832
Understood.

661
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:19,168
Hey, Mickey, tomorrow.
You get a couple of guys.

662
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:21,953
You go over to Luca's apartment. Hang
around. Wait for him to show up.

663
00:55:21,977 --> 00:55:25,455
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

664
00:55:25,565 --> 00:55:27,810
Yeah.

665
00:55:27,834 --> 00:55:31,361
Listen, hang around the house
on the phone. It'll be a big help.

666
00:55:32,472 --> 00:55:34,972
Try Luca again. Go ahead.

667
00:55:43,316 --> 00:55:46,149
- What the hell is this?
- It's a Sicilian message.

668
00:55:46,252 --> 00:55:48,752
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

669
00:56:02,535 --> 00:56:05,035
- I'm goin' now.
- What time you gonna be home tonight?

670
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:07,571
I don't know. Probably late.

671
00:56:08,841 --> 00:56:12,368
- Don't forget the cannoli.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:18,881
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rearview mirror.

673
00:56:21,054 --> 00:56:22,598
That Sonny's runnin' wild.

674
00:56:22,622 --> 00:56:24,667
He's thinkin' of goin'
to the mattresses already.

675
00:56:24,691 --> 00:56:27,251
We gotta find a spot
over on the West Side.

676
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,454
We'll try 309 West 43rd Street.

677
00:56:30,563 --> 00:56:32,908
You know any good spots
on the West Side?

678
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:35,812
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- Well, think about it while you're drivin'.

679
00:56:35,836 --> 00:56:37,780
I wanna hit New York sometime this month.

680
00:56:37,804 --> 00:56:40,304
And watch out for the kids
when you're backin' out.

681
00:56:50,683 --> 00:56:53,095
Hey, Paulie, I want you to go
down 39th Street. Colosanto's.

682
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,179
You pick up 18 mattresses for the guys
to sleep, will you? Bring me the bill.

683
00:56:56,289 --> 00:56:59,190
- Yeah, all right.
- Make sure they're clean because...

684
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:02,489
Those guys are gonna be stuck up in there for a long time, you know?

685
00:57:02,595 --> 00:57:04,773
They're clean. They told me
they exterminate them.

686
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:06,875
"Exterminate"?
That's a bad word to use.

687
00:57:06,899 --> 00:57:09,868
Exterminate. Get this guy.
See how we don't exterminate you.

688
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:12,469
<i>- Youse funny, or what?
- Hey, Paulie. Did you fart?</i>

689
00:57:13,673 --> 00:57:16,173
- Yeah, Rocco, what'd you do?
- No, me. Nothin'. It wasn't me.

690
00:57:16,242 --> 00:57:18,287
- It's gotta be him.
- Hey, pull over, will you.

691
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:20,811
I gotta take a leak.

692
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:03,799
Leave the gun.

693
00:58:03,823 --> 00:58:06,323
Take the cannoli.

694
00:58:23,112 --> 00:58:24,612
<i>Hey, Mike?</i>

695
00:58:25,113 --> 00:58:26,613
<i>Hey, Mikey?</i>

696
00:58:28,114 --> 00:58:29,114
Yeah?

697
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,614
<i>You're wanted on the telephone.</i>

698
00:58:36,322 --> 00:58:38,822
- Who is it?
- It's some girl.

699
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:44,072
Hello, Kay?

700
00:58:44,096 --> 00:58:45,441
<i>How's your father?</i>

701
00:58:45,465 --> 00:58:47,242
He's good. He's gonna make it.

702
00:58:47,266 --> 00:58:49,743
<i>I love you.</i>

703
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:50,767
Huh?

704
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,070
<i>I love you!</i>

705
00:58:53,306 --> 00:58:54,807
<i>Michael?</i>

706
00:58:55,185 --> 00:58:56,185
Yeah, I know.

707
00:58:56,209 --> 00:58:57,986
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

708
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,687
Yeah, I can't talk.

709
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,511
<i>Can't you say it?</i>

710
00:59:02,315 --> 00:59:04,815
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

711
00:59:05,017 --> 00:59:08,009
Hey, Mikey. Why don't you tell
that nice girl you love her?

712
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,165
I love you with all o' my heart!

713
00:59:10,189 --> 00:59:12,714
If I don't see you again a-soon,
I'm-a gonna die!

714
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,938
Come over here, kid.
Learn somethin'.

715
00:59:15,962 --> 00:59:18,462
You never know. You might have to cook
for 20 guys someday.

716
00:59:18,965 --> 00:59:21,276
You see? You start out
with a little bit of oil.

717
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,845
Then you fry some garlic.

718
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:25,497
Then you throw in some tomatoes,
some tomato paste.

719
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:28,267
You fry it.
You make sure it doesn't stick.

720
00:59:28,374 --> 00:59:31,537
When you got it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and your meatballs.

721
00:59:34,413 --> 00:59:36,913
Add a little bit of wine.

722
00:59:39,752 --> 00:59:42,653
And a little bit of sugar.

723
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,400
- And that's my trick.
- Why don't you cut the crap?

724
00:59:45,424 --> 00:59:47,569
I got more important things
for you to do.

725
00:59:47,593 --> 00:59:50,187
- How's Paulie?
- Oh, Paulie. Won't see him no more.

726
00:59:52,265 --> 00:59:54,743
- Where you going?
- To the city.

727
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:56,411
Send some bodyguards with him.

728
00:59:56,435 --> 00:59:58,413
- No. I'm just going to the hospital to see Pop.
- Nevermind. Send somebody with him.

729
00:59:58,437 --> 01:00:01,338
Oh, he'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

730
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,940
- All right. Be careful, huh?
- Yes, sir.

731
01:00:06,946 --> 01:00:09,446
Send somebody with him anyway.

732
01:00:37,643 --> 01:00:39,454
I have to go.

733
01:00:39,478 --> 01:00:41,978
Can I go with you?

734
01:00:42,315 --> 01:00:44,875
No, Kay. There's gonna be
detectives there.

735
01:00:44,984 --> 01:00:46,962
People from the press.

736
01:00:46,986 --> 01:00:49,486
Well, I'll ride in a cab.

737
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,990
I don't want you to get involved.

738
01:00:56,662 --> 01:00:59,162
When will I see you again?

739
01:01:05,338 --> 01:01:07,316
Go back to New Hampshire...

740
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,840
and I'll call you
at your parents' house.

741
01:01:11,177 --> 01:01:13,677
When will I see you again,
Michael?

742
01:01:15,181 --> 01:01:17,681
I don't know.

743
01:03:27,713 --> 01:03:29,825
What are you doing here?

744
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:31,927
You're not supposed
to be here now.

745
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:35,512
I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.

746
01:03:35,621 --> 01:03:38,181
There's nobody here.
What happened to the guards?

747
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:40,602
Your father just had
too many visitors.

748
01:03:40,626 --> 01:03:43,527
They interfered
with hospital service.

749
01:03:43,629 --> 01:03:46,530
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

750
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:55,372
Get me Long Beach 4-5-6-2-0, please.

751
01:03:57,977 --> 01:04:00,477
Nurse, wait a minute. Stay here.

752
01:04:04,316 --> 01:04:06,628
Sonny, Michael.
I'm at the hospital.

753
01:04:06,652 --> 01:04:09,212
Listen. I got here late.
There's nobody here.

754
01:04:09,321 --> 01:04:12,313
Nobody. No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody.

755
01:04:12,424 --> 01:04:15,222
<i>- Pop is all alone.
- Don't panic. We'll send somebody.</i>

756
01:04:15,327 --> 01:04:17,639
I won't panic.

757
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:20,223
I'm sorry, but you will
have to leave.

758
01:04:23,169 --> 01:04:25,899
You and I are gonna move my father
to another room.

759
01:04:26,005 --> 01:04:29,065
Now, can you disconnect those tubes
so we can move the bed out?

760
01:04:29,175 --> 01:04:32,667
- That's out of the question.
- Do you know my father?

761
01:04:32,778 --> 01:04:34,956
Men are coming here to kill him.

762
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,092
You understand?

763
01:04:37,116 --> 01:04:39,616
Now, help me, please.

764
01:05:55,961 --> 01:06:00,694
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo... the baker.

765
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,277
- You remember me?
- Enzo?

766
01:06:02,301 --> 01:06:04,181
- Yes, Enzo.
- You better get out of here, Enzo.

767
01:06:04,205 --> 01:06:06,114
There's gonna be trouble.

768
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:08,617
If there is trouble,
I stay here to help you...

769
01:06:08,641 --> 01:06:11,141
For your father. For your father.

770
01:06:12,144 --> 01:06:13,955
All right, listen.

771
01:06:13,979 --> 01:06:16,124
Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital.

772
01:06:16,148 --> 01:06:19,151
All right? I'll be out
in a minute. Go ahead.

773
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:20,575
Okay, okay.

774
01:06:33,098 --> 01:06:37,398
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

775
01:06:38,604 --> 01:06:41,104
I'm with you now.

776
01:06:42,274 --> 01:06:44,774
I'm with you.

777
01:07:19,311 --> 01:07:21,811
Get rid of these. Come here.

778
01:07:22,147 --> 01:07:24,647
Put your hand in your pocket
like you have a gun.

779
01:07:25,317 --> 01:07:27,817
You'll be all right.

780
01:07:32,091 --> 01:07:34,591
You'll be okay.

781
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,803
You did good.

782
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:56,084
Here he is.

783
01:08:56,108 --> 01:08:58,608
All right, hold still.

784
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,465
I thought I got
all you guinea hoods locked up.

785
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:11,933
What the hell are you doing here?

786
01:09:11,957 --> 01:09:14,457
What happened to the men who
were guarding my father, Captain?

787
01:09:14,793 --> 01:09:16,438
Why, you little punk.

788
01:09:16,462 --> 01:09:18,502
What the hell are you doing,
telling me my business?

789
01:09:18,526 --> 01:09:20,341
I pulled them guys off of here.

790
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:23,357
Now, you get out of here
and stay away from this hospital.

791
01:09:23,469 --> 01:09:26,438
I'm not moving until you put
some guards around my father's room.

792
01:09:27,139 --> 01:09:29,117
Phil, take him in.

793
01:09:29,141 --> 01:09:31,553
The kid's clean, Captain.
He's a war hero.

794
01:09:31,577 --> 01:09:34,478
- He's never been busted...
- Goddamn it, I said take him in.

795
01:09:36,582 --> 01:09:39,107
What's the Turk paying you
to set up my father, Captain?

796
01:09:40,419 --> 01:09:42,530
Take a hold of him.
Stand him up.

797
01:09:42,554 --> 01:09:45,054
Stand him up straight.

798
01:10:06,945 --> 01:10:08,990
I'm the attorney
for the Corleone family.

799
01:10:09,014 --> 01:10:11,744
These men are private detectives
hired to protect Vito Corleone.

800
01:10:12,618 --> 01:10:14,362
They're licensed to carry firearms.

801
01:10:14,386 --> 01:10:16,886
If you interfere, you'll have to
appear before a judge...

802
01:10:16,955 --> 01:10:19,515
in the morning and show cause.

803
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:22,125
All right, let him go.

804
01:10:22,194 --> 01:10:24,694
Come on.

805
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,137
What's with all the new faces?

806
01:10:56,161 --> 01:10:57,972
Gonna need 'em now.

807
01:10:57,996 --> 01:11:00,624
After the hospital thing,
Sonny got mad.

808
01:11:00,732 --> 01:11:03,860
We hit Bruno Tattaglia
at 4:00 this morning.

809
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:07,670
Jesus Christ.

810
01:11:14,012 --> 01:11:16,512
Looks like a fortress around here.

811
01:11:21,019 --> 01:11:23,920
A hundred button men on the street,
24 hours a day.

812
01:11:24,022 --> 01:11:27,253
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.

813
01:11:29,861 --> 01:11:32,361
Hey, Mike, come here.
Let me look at you.

814
01:11:35,801 --> 01:11:37,478
You look beautiful.
Just beautiful.

815
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,980
You're gorgeous.

816
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:41,700
Hey, listen to this.
The Turk, he wants to talk.

817
01:11:41,807 --> 01:11:44,537
Imagine the nerve
on this son of a bitch.

818
01:11:44,643 --> 01:11:46,955
Craps out last night,
he wants a meeting today.

819
01:11:46,979 --> 01:11:49,479
- What'd he say?
- What did he say?

820
01:11:50,148 --> 01:11:52,293
He wants us to send Michael
to hear the proposition.

821
01:11:52,317 --> 01:11:55,377
And the promise is that the deal
is so good that we can't refuse.

822
01:11:55,988 --> 01:11:57,632
What about Bruno Tattaglia?

823
01:11:57,656 --> 01:11:59,300
That's part of the deal.

824
01:11:59,324 --> 01:12:01,302
Bruno cancels out what they did
to my father.

825
01:12:01,326 --> 01:12:03,826
Sonny, we ought to hear
what they have to say.

826
01:12:04,163 --> 01:12:06,641
No. No. No. No more.
Not this time, Consigliere.

827
01:12:06,665 --> 01:12:10,226
No more meetings, no more discussions,
no more Sollozzo tricks.

828
01:12:10,335 --> 01:12:12,146
You give them one message...
I want Sollozzo.

829
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:13,815
If not, it's all-out war.
We go to the mattresses.

830
01:12:13,839 --> 01:12:15,919
Some of the other families
won't sit still for a war.

831
01:12:15,943 --> 01:12:18,423
- Then they hand me Sollozzo.
- Your father wouldn't hear this.

832
01:12:18,447 --> 01:12:20,736
- This is business, not personal.
- They shot my father.

833
01:12:20,846 --> 01:12:24,247
Even shooting your father
was business, not personal, Sonny.

834
01:12:24,349 --> 01:12:26,349
Well, then business will have to suffer.
All right?

835
01:12:26,373 --> 01:12:27,996
And do me a favor, Tom...

836
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,998
No more advice on how
to patch things up.

837
01:12:30,022 --> 01:12:32,522
Just help me win, please.
All right?

838
01:12:38,463 --> 01:12:41,023
I found out about this Captain McCluskey
who broke Mike's jaw.

839
01:12:41,133 --> 01:12:42,610
What about him?

840
01:12:42,634 --> 01:12:45,694
Now he's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

841
01:12:45,804 --> 01:12:48,705
McCluskey has agreed
to be the Turk's bodyguard.

842
01:12:48,807 --> 01:12:50,785
What you have to understand,
Sonny...

843
01:12:50,809 --> 01:12:52,954
is that while Sollozzo's
being guarded like this...

844
01:12:52,978 --> 01:12:54,789
he is invulnerable.

845
01:12:54,813 --> 01:12:58,374
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain. Never.

846
01:12:58,483 --> 01:13:01,543
It would be disastrous. All the
five families would come after you, Sonny.

847
01:13:01,653 --> 01:13:04,383
The Corleone family
would be outcast.

848
01:13:04,489 --> 01:13:08,186
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

849
01:13:09,661 --> 01:13:11,806
So do me a favor.

850
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:14,458
Take this into consideration.

851
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:19,769
All right, we'll wait.

852
01:13:24,509 --> 01:13:26,988
We can't wait.

853
01:13:27,012 --> 01:13:28,990
Can't wait.

854
01:13:29,014 --> 01:13:30,774
I don't care what Sollozzo says
about a deal.

855
01:13:30,798 --> 01:13:32,927
He's gonna kill Pop. That's it.

856
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:34,762
That's the key for him.

857
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:36,764
Got to get Sollozzo.

858
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:38,933
CLEMENZA: Mike is right.

859
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:40,935
Let me ask you something first.

860
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:44,019
What about this McCluskey?

861
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:46,629
What do we do with this cop here?

862
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:53,469
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

863
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:57,533
It will be me...

864
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:00,142
McCluskey and Sollozzo.

865
01:14:01,146 --> 01:14:03,646
Let's set the meeting.

866
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:08,718
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

867
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:14,553
Now we insist it's a public place...
a bar, a restaurant.

868
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:18,390
Some place where there's people,
so I feel safe.

869
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:24,234
They're gonna search me
when I first meet them, right?

870
01:14:24,336 --> 01:14:26,836
So I can't have a weapon on me then.

871
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:32,508
But if Clemenza can figure a way...

872
01:14:32,611 --> 01:14:35,111
to have a weapon
planted there for me...

873
01:14:39,951 --> 01:14:42,451
then I'll kill them both.

874
01:14:54,332 --> 01:14:56,857
What are you gonna do?
Nice college boy, huh?

875
01:14:56,946 --> 01:14:58,946
Didn't want to get mixed up
in the family business.

876
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:00,948
Now you want to gun down
a police captain?

877
01:15:00,972 --> 01:15:02,989
Why? 'Cause he slapped you
in the face a little bit?

878
01:15:03,013 --> 01:15:05,325
What do you think this is, the army,
where you shoot them a mile away?

879
01:15:05,349 --> 01:15:06,954
You gotta get up close,
like this and...

880
01:15:06,978 --> 01:15:10,379
You blow their brains all over your
nice Ivy League suit. Come here.

881
01:15:10,482 --> 01:15:12,794
You're taking this very personal.

882
01:15:12,818 --> 01:15:16,049
Tom, this is business, and this man
is taking it very, very personal.

883
01:15:16,154 --> 01:15:18,166
Where does it say that
you can't kill a cop?

884
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:20,715
- Come on, Mikey.
- Tom, wait a minute.

885
01:15:20,826 --> 01:15:23,556
I'm talking about a cop
that's mixed up in drugs.

886
01:15:23,662 --> 01:15:27,792
I'm talking about a dishonest cop,
a crooked cop...

887
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:30,766
who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming to him.

888
01:15:30,869 --> 01:15:32,914
That's a terrific story.

889
01:15:32,938 --> 01:15:35,668
Now we have newspaper people
on the payroll, don't we, Tom?

890
01:15:37,209 --> 01:15:39,420
They might like a story like that.

891
01:15:39,444 --> 01:15:41,944
They might. They just might.

892
01:15:44,783 --> 01:15:46,928
It's not personal, Sonny.

893
01:15:46,952 --> 01:15:49,452
It's strictly business.

894
01:15:51,456 --> 01:15:53,100
It's as cold as they come.

895
01:15:53,124 --> 01:15:56,685
Impossible to trace, so you don't
worry about prints, Mike.

896
01:15:56,795 --> 01:15:59,696
I put a special tape
on the trigger and the butt.

897
01:15:59,798 --> 01:16:02,298
Here. Try it.

898
01:16:12,978 --> 01:16:15,478
What's the matter,
the trigger too tight?

899
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:20,795
- My ears.
- I left it noisy.

900
01:16:20,819 --> 01:16:25,552
That way it scares pain-in-the-ass
innocent bystanders away.

901
01:16:25,657 --> 01:16:28,157
All right, you shot them both.
Now what do you do?

902
01:16:30,762 --> 01:16:32,907
Sit down, finish my dinner.

903
01:16:32,931 --> 01:16:34,575
Come on, kid. Don't fool around.

904
01:16:34,599 --> 01:16:38,160
Just let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

905
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:40,414
Everybody will still think
you got it.

906
01:16:40,438 --> 01:16:42,583
They're gonna be staring
at your face, Mike...

907
01:16:42,607 --> 01:16:45,667
so walk out of the place real fast,
but you don't run.

908
01:16:45,777 --> 01:16:49,178
Don't look nobody directly in the
eye, but you don't look away, either.

909
01:16:49,281 --> 01:16:51,481
Hey, they're gonna be scared stiff
of you, believe me...

910
01:16:51,505 --> 01:16:54,005
so don't worry about nothing.

911
01:16:54,953 --> 01:16:56,764
You know, you're gonna turn out all right.

912
01:16:56,788 --> 01:16:59,100
You take a long vacation,
nobody knows where...

913
01:16:59,124 --> 01:17:01,602
and we're gonna catch the hell.

914
01:17:01,626 --> 01:17:03,771
How bad do you think
it's gonna be?

915
01:17:03,795 --> 01:17:05,773
Pretty goddamn bad.

916
01:17:05,797 --> 01:17:08,857
Probably all the other families
will line up against us.

917
01:17:08,967 --> 01:17:11,868
That's all right. These things
gotta happen every five years or so.

918
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:14,530
Ten years.
Helps to get rid of the bad blood.

919
01:17:14,639 --> 01:17:17,199
Been ten years since
the last one.

920
01:17:17,309 --> 01:17:19,287
You know, you gotta stop them
at the beginning...

921
01:17:19,311 --> 01:17:21,455
like they should have
stopped Hitler at Munich.

922
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:23,457
They should have never let him
get away with that.

923
01:17:23,481 --> 01:17:25,981
They was just asking
for big trouble.

924
01:17:26,318 --> 01:17:28,878
You know, Mike,
we was all proud of you...

925
01:17:28,987 --> 01:17:30,731
being a hero and all.

926
01:17:30,755 --> 01:17:33,255
Your father too.

927
01:18:10,629 --> 01:18:12,440
Nothing. Not a hint.

928
01:18:12,464 --> 01:18:14,964
Absolutely nothing.

929
01:18:15,133 --> 01:18:18,034
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting's going to be held.

930
01:18:19,304 --> 01:18:21,804
How much time do we have?

931
01:18:22,641 --> 01:18:24,721
Gonna pick you up in front
of Jack Dempsey's joint...

932
01:18:24,745 --> 01:18:27,245
in an hour and a half...
exactly an hour and a half.

933
01:18:28,647 --> 01:18:31,147
We could put a tail on them,
see how it turns out.

934
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:34,480
Sollozzo'll lose our ass
going around the block.

935
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:36,097
What about the negotiator?

936
01:18:36,121 --> 01:18:38,817
He's over at my place playing
pinochle with a couple of my men.

937
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:40,701
He's happy.
They're letting him win.

938
01:18:40,725 --> 01:18:44,354
It's too much of a risk for Mike.
Maybe we ought to call it off, Sonny.

939
01:18:44,462 --> 01:18:48,023
The negotiator keeps on playing cards
until Mike comes back safe and sound.

940
01:18:48,091 --> 01:18:50,411
So why don't they just blast who's ever
in the goddamn car?

941
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:52,413
Too dangerous.
They'll be looking for that.

942
01:18:52,437 --> 01:18:54,937
Sollozzo might not
even be in the car, Sonny.

943
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:58,107
I get it.

944
01:19:07,452 --> 01:19:09,952
Yeah.

945
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:25,701
- Louis Restaurant in the Bronx.
- Well is it reliable?

946
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:27,615
That's my man in McCluskey's precinct.

947
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:30,472
A police captain's got to be
on call 24 hours a day.

948
01:19:30,575 --> 01:19:33,476
He signed out at that number
between 8:00 and 10:00.

949
01:19:33,578 --> 01:19:35,122
Anybody know this joint?

950
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:38,547
Yeah, sure. I do.
It's perfect for us.

951
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:40,895
A small family place, good food.

952
01:19:40,919 --> 01:19:43,752
Everyone minds his business.
It's perfect.

953
01:19:43,855 --> 01:19:46,653
Pete, they got
an old-fashioned toilet...

954
01:19:46,758 --> 01:19:49,989
You know, the box
and the chain thing.

955
01:19:51,596 --> 01:19:54,156
We might be able
to tape the gun behind it.

956
01:19:54,265 --> 01:19:55,743
All right.

957
01:19:55,767 --> 01:19:58,930
Mike, you go to the restaurant.

958
01:19:59,037 --> 01:20:01,415
You eat, you talk for a while,
you relax.

959
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:03,117
You make them relax.

960
01:20:03,141 --> 01:20:05,486
Then you get up
and go take a leak.

961
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:08,172
No, better still,
you ask for permission to go.

962
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:10,124
And when you come back,
you come out blasting.

963
01:20:10,148 --> 01:20:13,083
And don't take any chances.
Two shots in the head apiece.

964
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:15,262
Now, listen.
I want somebody good...

965
01:20:15,286 --> 01:20:17,264
and I mean very good...
to plant that gun.

966
01:20:17,288 --> 01:20:20,968
I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet
with just his dick in his hands, all right?

967
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,103
The gun will be there.

968
01:20:22,127 --> 01:20:26,359
All right, listen. You drive him
and you pick him up after the job.

969
01:20:26,464 --> 01:20:28,964
Come on. Let's move.

970
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:31,533
Thank you, Tom.

971
01:20:33,805 --> 01:20:36,706
Did he tell you
to drop the gun right away?

972
01:20:36,808 --> 01:20:39,308
Yeah, a million times.

973
01:20:43,481 --> 01:20:45,960
Now, you don't forget...
two shots apiece in the head...

974
01:20:45,984 --> 01:20:48,129
as soon as you
come out the door.

975
01:20:48,153 --> 01:20:50,653
Let's go.

976
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:56,889
How long do you think it'll be
before I can come back?

977
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:00,975
At least a year, Mike.

978
01:21:00,999 --> 01:21:04,560
Listen, I'll square it with Mom, you know,
you not seeing her before you leave...

979
01:21:04,669 --> 01:21:09,072
and I'll get a message
to that girlfriend...

980
01:21:09,174 --> 01:21:11,674
when I think the time is right.

981
01:21:16,848 --> 01:21:19,348
Take care.

982
01:21:21,519 --> 01:21:24,019
- See you, Mike.
- Okay, Tom.

983
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,798
I'm glad you came, Mike.

984
01:21:57,822 --> 01:22:00,322
I hope we can
straighten everything out.

985
01:22:00,992 --> 01:22:03,859
I mean, this is terrible. It's not the way
I wanted things to go at all.

986
01:22:03,962 --> 01:22:05,806
It should have never happened.

987
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:07,975
I want to straighten
everything out tonight.

988
01:22:07,999 --> 01:22:10,477
I don't want my father
bothered anymore.

989
01:22:10,501 --> 01:22:14,562
He won't be, Mike.
I swear on my children he won't be.

990
01:22:14,672 --> 01:22:17,903
But you got to keep an open mind
when we talk.

991
01:22:18,009 --> 01:22:20,487
I mean, I hope you're not a hot-head
like your brother Sonny.

992
01:22:20,511 --> 01:22:23,011
You can't talk business
with him.

993
01:22:24,182 --> 01:22:26,682
He's a good kid.

994
01:22:30,021 --> 01:22:32,521
I'm sorry about
the other night, Mike.

995
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:36,103
I gotta frisk you,
so turn around, huh?

996
01:22:36,127 --> 01:22:38,627
On your knees, facing me.

997
01:22:42,467 --> 01:22:45,368
I guess I'm getting
too old for my job.

998
01:22:46,471 --> 01:22:48,515
Too grouchy.

999
01:22:48,539 --> 01:22:51,201
Can't stand the aggravation.

1000
01:22:51,309 --> 01:22:53,809
You know how it is.

1001
01:22:54,646 --> 01:22:57,146
He's clean.

1002
01:23:23,007 --> 01:23:25,507
We're going to Jersey?

1003
01:23:27,178 --> 01:23:29,678
Maybe.

1004
01:23:54,305 --> 01:23:56,805
Nice work, Lou.

1005
01:24:33,478 --> 01:24:35,522
How's the Italian food
in this restaurant?

1006
01:24:35,546 --> 01:24:37,958
Good. Try the veal.

1007
01:24:37,982 --> 01:24:40,482
- It's the best in the city.
- I'll have it.

1008
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:43,983
<i>Understand?</i>

1009
01:25:16,487 --> 01:25:18,332
I'm gonna speak Italian to Mike.

1010
01:25:18,356 --> 01:25:20,856
Go ahead.

1011
01:25:25,756 --> 01:25:28,256
- I'm sorry.
- Forget about it.

1012
01:25:31,257 --> 01:25:37,257
What happened to
your father was business.

1013
01:25:39,258 --> 01:25:42,235
I have much respect for your father...

1014
01:25:42,259 --> 01:25:46,259
but your father's thinking
is old fashioned.

1015
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:51,260
You must understand why
I did what I did.

1016
01:25:52,261 --> 01:25:55,261
I understand these things.

1017
01:25:55,762 --> 01:25:57,439
I do.

1018
01:25:57,463 --> 01:25:59,963
You do.

1019
01:26:10,464 --> 01:26:14,464
Now we have to think about what happens

1020
01:26:14,765 --> 01:26:18,665
between you and the Tattaglias.

1021
01:26:19,465 --> 01:26:23,442
We have to work through

1022
01:26:23,466 --> 01:26:27,466
where we go from here.

1023
01:26:34,966 --> 01:26:37,466
How do I say...?

1024
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:41,770
What I want...

1025
01:26:41,939 --> 01:26:44,439
what's most important to me...

1026
01:26:46,777 --> 01:26:48,922
is that I have a guarantee:

1027
01:26:48,946 --> 01:26:51,091
No more attempts
on my father's life.

1028
01:26:51,115 --> 01:26:55,347
What guarantees could I give you, Mike?
I am the hunted one.

1029
01:26:55,953 --> 01:26:59,013
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

1030
01:26:59,123 --> 01:27:01,623
I'm not that clever.

1031
01:27:02,793 --> 01:27:05,293
All I want is a truce.

1032
01:27:11,802 --> 01:27:15,499
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is that all right?

1033
01:27:16,807 --> 01:27:19,307
You gotta go, you gotta go.

1034
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:26,560
I frisked him. He's clean.

1035
01:27:26,584 --> 01:27:29,084
Don't take too long.

1036
01:27:32,256 --> 01:27:34,756
I've frisked a thousand young punks.

1037
01:28:50,054 --> 01:28:52,554
Everything all right?

1038
01:28:53,555 --> 01:28:56,032
I respect myself... understand?

1039
01:28:56,056 --> 01:28:59,056
And so I cannot allow your
father to hold me back.

1040
01:28:59,857 --> 01:29:02,857
What happened was unavoidable.

1041
01:29:03,858 --> 01:29:06,335
I had the unspoken support of
the other Dons.

1042
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:08,836
If your father were in better health...

1043
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:11,360
without his eldest son running things...

1044
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:26,666
Hey, come on.

1045
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:29,190
Come on. Let's go.

1046
01:32:24,849 --> 01:32:27,349
Joe, you take over.

1047
01:32:30,187 --> 01:32:32,687
Hi, Grandpa.

1048
01:32:44,134 --> 01:32:46,634
I love you, Grandpa.

1049
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:51,369
I'm sorry, Pa.
He doesn't know you yet.

1050
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:55,956
- Here you are, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

1051
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:58,124
"I hope you get red, Grandpa...

1052
01:32:58,148 --> 01:33:00,126
and I wish I would see you soon.

1053
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:02,650
Love, your grandson, Frank."

1054
01:33:05,155 --> 01:33:07,467
Go with your mother.

1055
01:33:07,491 --> 01:33:09,991
Go ahead. Take 'em downstairs.

1056
01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:18,166
Go on, Carlo. You too.

1057
01:33:19,503 --> 01:33:22,003
Go on.

1058
01:33:24,508 --> 01:33:27,739
I got chicken cacciatore
for you, sweetheart.

1059
01:33:27,845 --> 01:33:29,723
- That's enough bread.
- I like bread.

1060
01:33:29,747 --> 01:33:32,247
I know, but how much can you eat?

1061
01:33:41,792 --> 01:33:43,770
What's the matter with you, Carlo?

1062
01:33:43,794 --> 01:33:46,294
Shut up and set the table.

1063
01:34:01,478 --> 01:34:04,038
Since McCluskey's killing...

1064
01:34:04,148 --> 01:34:07,549
the police have been cracking down
most of our operations.

1065
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:11,820
And also the other families'.

1066
01:34:12,323 --> 01:34:14,100
Been a lot of bad blood.

1067
01:34:14,124 --> 01:34:17,616
They hit us, so we hit them back.

1068
01:34:18,495 --> 01:34:20,640
Through our contacts
in the newspapers...

1069
01:34:20,664 --> 01:34:22,976
we've been able to put out
a lot of material...

1070
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,401
about McCluskey being linked
with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

1071
01:34:27,671 --> 01:34:30,171
See, things are
starting to loosen up.

1072
01:34:30,774 --> 01:34:35,507
Dad, I'm sending Fredo
to Las Vegas...

1073
01:34:35,613 --> 01:34:38,207
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

1074
01:34:38,315 --> 01:34:40,260
I want him to rest.

1075
01:34:40,284 --> 01:34:42,762
I'm going to learn
the casino business.

1076
01:34:42,786 --> 01:34:45,286
Yeah.

1077
01:34:50,961 --> 01:34:53,461
Where is Michael?

1078
01:35:05,309 --> 01:35:07,903
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

1079
01:35:10,314 --> 01:35:14,045
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back now.

1080
01:35:35,773 --> 01:35:38,373
I want you to find out where that
little pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

1081
01:35:38,397 --> 01:35:39,919
I want his ass now... right now.

1082
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:41,755
- Hey, Sonny.
- What?

1083
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:43,590
Things are starting to loosen up
a little bit.

1084
01:35:43,614 --> 01:35:46,344
If you go after Tattaglia,
all hell's going to break loose.

1085
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:48,428
Let the smoke clear.
Pop can negotiate.

1086
01:35:48,452 --> 01:35:50,930
No, Pop can't do nothing till
he's better. I'm gonna decide what...

1087
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:52,994
All right, but your war's
costing us a lot of money.

1088
01:35:53,018 --> 01:35:54,768
Nothing's coming in.
We can't do business.

1089
01:35:54,792 --> 01:35:57,522
Well neither can they.
Don't worry about it.

1090
01:35:57,628 --> 01:35:59,606
- We can't afford a stalemate.
- Well, then there ain't no more stalemate.

1091
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:01,608
I'm gonna end it
by killing that old bastard.

1092
01:36:01,632 --> 01:36:03,777
You're getting a great reputation.
I hope you're enjoying it.

1093
01:36:03,801 --> 01:36:05,445
Well you just do what I tell you to do!

1094
01:36:05,469 --> 01:36:07,629
Goddamn it, if I had a wartime
consigliere, a Sicilian,

1095
01:36:07,653 --> 01:36:09,616
I wouldn't be in this shape!

1096
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:12,140
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

1097
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:17,979
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

1098
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:22,008
Mom made a little dinner.
It's Sunday.

1099
01:36:22,986 --> 01:36:25,716
Them niggers are having
a good time...

1100
01:36:25,823 --> 01:36:27,467
with our policy banks
up there in Harlem.

1101
01:36:27,491 --> 01:36:31,325
Driving them new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

1102
01:36:31,428 --> 01:36:34,829
I knew that was gonna happen as soon
as they started making big money.

1103
01:36:34,932 --> 01:36:38,493
Look, Papa never talked business
at the table in front of the kids.

1104
01:36:38,602 --> 01:36:41,332
- Hey, shut up, Connie.
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

1105
01:36:41,438 --> 01:36:44,498
- You got that?
- Santino, don't interfere.

1106
01:36:46,443 --> 01:36:49,043
You know, Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk
to you, maybe after dinner.

1107
01:36:49,113 --> 01:36:51,091
I could be doing a lot more
for the family.

1108
01:36:51,115 --> 01:36:53,615
We don't discuss business
at the table.

1109
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:43,230
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

1110
01:37:46,537 --> 01:37:48,037
Michael

1111
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:50,780
Why are you so far
from the house?

1112
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:54,110
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

1113
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,490
The bodyguards are here.

1114
01:37:56,410 --> 01:37:57,740
It's still dangerous...

1115
01:37:58,870 --> 01:38:00,620
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

1116
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,290
Your enemies know you're here.

1117
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:08,040
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

1118
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:10,000
Not yet.

1119
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:12,510
It's out of the question.

1120
01:38:15,970 --> 01:38:17,390
Where are you going now?

1121
01:38:18,026 --> 01:38:19,026
Corleone.

1122
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:20,100
To Corleone.

1123
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:21,970
Take my car.

1124
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:26,350
I want to walk.

1125
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:30,150
Be careful.

1126
01:38:50,539 --> 01:38:52,539
Look there. Corleone.

1127
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,060
Where have all the men gone?

1128
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:09,310
They're all dead from vendettas.

1129
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:13,360
There are the names of the dead.

1130
01:39:29,876 --> 01:39:33,209
Hey, American!
Take me to the America! G.I.!

1131
01:39:33,776 --> 01:39:34,776
Hey, hey, hey!

1132
01:39:34,815 --> 01:39:37,875
Take me to America, G.I.
Clark Gable.

1133
01:39:38,376 --> 01:39:39,853
America! America!

1134
01:39:39,877 --> 01:39:41,354
Take me to the America, G.I.

1135
01:39:41,378 --> 01:39:43,378
Clark Gable. Rita Hayworth.

1136
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:03,620
Mamma mia what a beauty.

1137
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:14,880
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

1138
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:25,100
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

1139
01:40:36,696 --> 01:40:38,696
Hey, host.

1140
01:40:40,397 --> 01:40:42,397
A bottle of wine.

1141
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:49,950
Did you have a good hunt?

1142
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:53,290
You know all the girls
around here?

1143
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:55,290
We saw some real beauties.

1144
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:59,630
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

1145
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:05,600
She would tempt the devil himself.

1146
01:41:13,230 --> 01:41:15,400
Really put together.

1147
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:16,520
Right, Calo?

1148
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,280
Such hair, such mouth!

1149
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:27,830
The girls around here are
beautiful... but virtuous.

1150
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:30,750
This one had a purple dress...

1151
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:33,250
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

1152
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:37,290
A type more Greek than Italian.

1153
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:41,550
Do you know her?

1154
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:48,760
There's no girl like that
in this town.

1155
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:52,680
My God, I understand!

1156
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:57,810
What's wrong?

1157
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:01,400
Let's go.

1158
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:04,610
It's his daughter.

1159
01:42:05,070 --> 01:42:06,570
Tell him to come here.

1160
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,330
Call him.

1161
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:33,720
Fabrizio, you translate.

1162
01:42:37,697 --> 01:42:40,197
I apologize if I offended you.

1163
01:42:41,034 --> 01:42:43,534
I'm a stranger in this country...

1164
01:42:44,037 --> 01:42:46,938
and I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

1165
01:42:52,712 --> 01:42:55,212
I'm an American hiding in Sicily.

1166
01:42:56,883 --> 01:42:59,383
My name is Michael Corleone.

1167
01:43:01,221 --> 01:43:03,862
There are people who would pay
a lot of money for that information.

1168
01:43:07,727 --> 01:43:10,227
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

1169
01:43:12,165 --> 01:43:14,665
instead of gaining a husband.

1170
01:43:22,409 --> 01:43:24,909
I want to meet your daughter...

1171
01:43:25,745 --> 01:43:27,556
with your permission...

1172
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:30,080
and under the supervision
of your family...

1173
01:43:31,017 --> 01:43:33,517
with all respect.

1174
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:42,790
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

1175
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,800
What's her name?

1176
01:43:51,204 --> 01:43:53,704
Apollonia.

1177
01:44:48,205 --> 01:44:51,182
...this is my daughter, Apollonia...

1178
01:44:51,206 --> 01:44:54,206
and this is Michael Corleone.

1179
01:45:10,207 --> 01:45:12,207
Thank you.

1180
01:45:12,808 --> 01:45:14,808
Your welcome.

1181
01:45:24,809 --> 01:45:27,309
What's the problem with your eye.

1182
01:45:27,810 --> 01:45:30,310
No, no. It's nothing. It's fine.

1183
01:46:45,011 --> 01:46:47,511
Hey! I'm gonna knock you dizzy.

1184
01:46:53,019 --> 01:46:55,519
Save it for the library.

1185
01:46:58,658 --> 01:47:01,158
Come on. We gotta go
pick up my sister. Let's go.

1186
01:47:19,379 --> 01:47:21,879
What's the matter?

1187
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:25,680
What's the matter?

1188
01:47:26,886 --> 01:47:29,031
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

1189
01:47:29,055 --> 01:47:32,456
Sonny, please. It was my fault.
Sonny, it was my fault. I hit him.

1190
01:47:32,559 --> 01:47:34,470
I started a fight with him.
Please, Sonny.

1191
01:47:34,494 --> 01:47:36,994
I'm sorry.

1192
01:47:40,968 --> 01:47:44,298
Okay, I'm just... I'm just gonna get a
doctor to come and take a look at you.

1193
01:47:44,504 --> 01:47:47,234
Sonny, please don't do anything.
Please, don't do it.

1194
01:47:49,342 --> 01:47:51,487
What's the matter with you?
What am I gonna do?

1195
01:47:51,511 --> 01:47:54,309
Am I gonna make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

1196
01:47:57,183 --> 01:47:58,661
All right?

1197
01:47:58,685 --> 01:48:01,779
Still betting the Yankees
pretty heavy?

1198
01:48:01,888 --> 01:48:04,388
Tell him to stop
taking action, all right?

1199
01:48:05,558 --> 01:48:08,058
You lost enough money
last weekend to me.

1200
01:48:13,933 --> 01:48:16,433
Carlo, come here.

1201
01:49:13,526 --> 01:49:16,256
You touch my sister again,
I'll kill you.

1202
01:53:11,597 --> 01:53:14,327
Weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

1203
01:53:14,433 --> 01:53:18,733
Yes, well, I have.
I mean I've tried writing and calling.

1204
01:53:18,838 --> 01:53:21,183
Now, I wanna reach Michael.

1205
01:53:21,207 --> 01:53:24,608
Nobody knows where he is. We know
that he's all right, but that's all.

1206
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:29,858
- What was that?
- That's an accident.

1207
01:53:29,882 --> 01:53:32,578
But nobody was hurt.

1208
01:53:32,652 --> 01:53:33,652
Tom...

1209
01:53:34,153 --> 01:53:37,987
Would you give this letter
to Michael, please? Please?

1210
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:40,402
Well, if I accepted that...

1211
01:53:40,426 --> 01:53:43,987
in a court of law they could prove that
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

1212
01:53:44,096 --> 01:53:46,816
Now you just be patient, Kay.
He'll get in touch with you, all right?

1213
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:50,201
I let my cab go, so can I come in
to call another one, please?

1214
01:53:50,303 --> 01:53:52,803
Come on. I'm sorry. Come on.

1215
01:54:09,121 --> 01:54:11,621
Hello?

1216
01:54:13,192 --> 01:54:14,937
<i>Is Carlo there?</i>

1217
01:54:14,961 --> 01:54:17,406
<i>- Who's this?
- This is a friend of Carlo's.</i>

1218
01:54:17,430 --> 01:54:20,490
<i>Would you tell him that
I can't make it tonight until later?</i>

1219
01:54:26,706 --> 01:54:29,206
Bitch.

1220
01:54:29,976 --> 01:54:32,570
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry yet.

1221
01:54:32,678 --> 01:54:34,656
Your food is on the table.
It's getting cold.

1222
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:37,740
- I'll eat out later.
- You just told me to make you dinner.

1223
01:54:37,850 --> 01:54:39,828
Hey, fuck you, eh?

1224
01:54:39,852 --> 01:54:42,352
Go fuck yourself!

1225
01:54:47,059 --> 01:54:49,559
This little guinea brat.

1226
01:54:53,966 --> 01:54:56,560
That's it. Break it all,
you spoiled guinea brat.

1227
01:54:56,669 --> 01:54:59,169
Break it all!

1228
01:55:01,874 --> 01:55:04,374
That's it. Break it all.

1229
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:11,678
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

1230
01:55:11,784 --> 01:55:14,284
Maybe I will. Why not?

1231
01:55:19,959 --> 01:55:22,404
- Now clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

1232
01:55:22,428 --> 01:55:24,906
Clean it up,
you guinea spoiled brat!

1233
01:55:24,930 --> 01:55:27,430
Clean it up! Clean it up!

1234
01:55:31,837 --> 01:55:34,337
You son of a bitch!

1235
01:55:43,015 --> 01:55:46,109
Come on, now! Kill me!
Be a murderer like your father!

1236
01:55:46,218 --> 01:55:48,530
- Come on! All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

1237
01:55:48,554 --> 01:55:50,265
- Come on!
- I'll kill you!

1238
01:55:50,289 --> 01:55:52,768
Kill me! Get up!

1239
01:55:52,792 --> 01:55:54,403
Get out of here!

1240
01:55:54,427 --> 01:55:57,919
- I hate you!
- Now go ahead. Now I'll kill you.

1241
01:55:58,030 --> 01:56:00,008
You guinea brat, you.

1242
01:56:00,032 --> 01:56:02,532
Get out here!

1243
01:56:11,377 --> 01:56:14,312
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you. What is it?

1244
01:56:15,481 --> 01:56:18,348
Honey, talk louder.
The baby's crying.

1245
01:56:18,451 --> 01:56:20,462
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

1246
01:56:20,486 --> 01:56:22,531
I don't understand.

1247
01:56:22,555 --> 01:56:25,055
Yeah, Connie.

1248
01:56:29,595 --> 01:56:32,095
Listen, you wait there.

1249
01:56:33,966 --> 01:56:36,466
No, you just wait there.

1250
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:41,171
- That son of a bitch.
- Sonny, what's the matter?

1251
01:56:41,273 --> 01:56:43,385
- Son of a bitch!
- What's the matter?

1252
01:56:43,409 --> 01:56:45,909
Damn it!

1253
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:50,708
Open the goddamn gate.
Get off your ass.

1254
01:57:07,233 --> 01:57:10,066
- Sonny, come on!
- Get out of here!

1255
01:57:10,169 --> 01:57:12,669
Go after him. Go on.

1256
01:57:41,066 --> 01:57:42,978
Son of a bitch.

1257
01:57:43,002 --> 01:57:45,502
Come on! Come on!

1258
01:59:32,578 --> 01:59:35,078
Give me a drop.

1259
01:59:42,688 --> 01:59:45,188
My wife is crying upstairs.

1260
01:59:47,359 --> 01:59:49,859
I hear cars coming to the house.

1261
01:59:54,433 --> 01:59:56,933
Consigliere of mine...

1262
01:59:57,803 --> 02:00:00,738
I think you should tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

1263
02:00:00,839 --> 02:00:03,339
Well, I didn't tell Mama anything.

1264
02:00:04,543 --> 02:00:08,070
I was about to come up and wake you
just now and tell you.

1265
02:00:11,216 --> 02:00:13,716
But you needed a drink first.

1266
02:00:20,292 --> 02:00:22,792
Now you've had your drink.

1267
02:00:28,334 --> 02:00:32,498
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

1268
02:00:49,788 --> 02:00:52,288
I want all inquiries made.

1269
02:00:56,462 --> 02:00:58,962
I want no acts of vengeance.

1270
02:01:00,499 --> 02:01:02,999
I want you to arrange a meeting...

1271
02:01:04,303 --> 02:01:06,803
with the heads
of the five families.

1272
02:01:09,041 --> 02:01:11,541
This war stops now.

1273
02:01:32,998 --> 02:01:35,523
Call Bonasera.

1274
02:01:35,634 --> 02:01:38,134
We need him now.

1275
02:01:49,982 --> 02:01:52,951
This is Tom Hagen
calling for Vito Corleone...

1276
02:01:53,052 --> 02:01:55,130
at his request.

1277
02:01:55,154 --> 02:01:57,432
Now, you owe your Don a service.

1278
02:01:57,456 --> 02:02:01,290
<i>He has no doubt that
you will repay it.</i>

1279
02:02:01,393 --> 02:02:04,157
<i>Now, he will be at your
funeral parlor in one hour.</i>

1280
02:02:04,263 --> 02:02:06,763
<i>Be there to greet him.</i>

1281
02:02:26,985 --> 02:02:29,297
Well, my friend...

1282
02:02:29,321 --> 02:02:31,766
are you ready
to do me this service?

1283
02:02:31,790 --> 02:02:33,435
Yes.

1284
02:02:33,459 --> 02:02:35,984
What do you want me to do?

1285
02:02:43,335 --> 02:02:46,361
I want you to use
all your powers...

1286
02:02:46,472 --> 02:02:48,972
and all your skills.

1287
02:02:51,977 --> 02:02:54,477
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

1288
02:03:11,029 --> 02:03:13,529
Look how they massacred my boy.

1289
02:03:42,990 --> 02:03:46,250
It's safer to teach you English!

1290
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,376
I know English...

1291
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:50,278
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday...

1292
02:03:50,302 --> 02:03:52,930
Wednesday, Friday,
Sunday, Saturday.

1293
02:04:00,510 --> 02:04:02,300
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

1294
02:04:03,010 --> 02:04:05,010
How are things in Palermo?

1295
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:15,070
Michael is teaching me to
drive... watch, I'll show you.

1296
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:19,700
How are things in Palermo?

1297
02:04:20,070 --> 02:04:23,200
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

1298
02:04:24,280 --> 02:04:27,660
times are changing for the worse.

1299
02:04:29,910 --> 02:04:33,330
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

1300
02:04:36,050 --> 02:04:41,220
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

1301
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:48,390
What's wrong?

1302
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:51,730
Bad news from America.

1303
02:04:54,190 --> 02:04:57,900
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

1304
02:05:04,490 --> 02:05:06,330
Let's go... you promised.

1305
02:05:25,117 --> 02:05:26,117
Fabrizio!

1306
02:05:26,141 --> 02:05:26,196
- Fabrizio.
- Yes, sir?

1307
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:27,640
Get the car.

1308
02:05:28,967 --> 02:05:30,612
Are you driving yourself, boss?

1309
02:05:30,636 --> 02:05:32,914
- Yes.
- Is your wife coming with you?

1310
02:05:32,938 --> 02:05:36,499
No. I want you to take her to her father's
house till I know things are safe.

1311
02:05:36,608 --> 02:05:39,108
Okay. Anything you say, boss.

1312
02:05:44,780 --> 02:05:46,530
Calo, where is Apollonia?

1313
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:50,790
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

1314
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:55,120
She'll make a good American wife.

1315
02:05:56,580 --> 02:05:59,130
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

1316
02:06:09,390 --> 02:06:11,560
Fabrizio!

1317
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:13,310
Where are you going?

1318
02:06:15,020 --> 02:06:17,440
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

1319
02:06:48,146 --> 02:06:50,058
Don Barzini,
I want to thank you...

1320
02:06:50,082 --> 02:06:53,609
for helping me organize
this meeting here today.

1321
02:06:53,719 --> 02:06:57,086
And also the other heads
of the five families...

1322
02:06:57,189 --> 02:06:59,689
from New York and New Jersey.

1323
02:07:00,692 --> 02:07:03,718
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx.

1324
02:07:06,198 --> 02:07:08,698
From Brooklyn...

1325
02:07:08,867 --> 02:07:11,367
Philip Tattaglia.

1326
02:07:12,771 --> 02:07:15,604
And from Staten Island...

1327
02:07:15,707 --> 02:07:18,972
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1328
02:07:19,077 --> 02:07:21,577
And all the other associates
that came as far...

1329
02:07:21,646 --> 02:07:24,774
as from California
and Kansas City...

1330
02:07:24,883 --> 02:07:27,295
and all the other territories
of the country.

1331
02:07:27,319 --> 02:07:29,819
Thank you.

1332
02:07:35,427 --> 02:07:37,927
How did things ever get so far?

1333
02:07:38,964 --> 02:07:41,464
I don't know.

1334
02:07:42,701 --> 02:07:46,193
It was so unfortunate
and so unnecessary.

1335
02:07:49,274 --> 02:07:51,486
Tattaglia lost a son...

1336
02:07:51,510 --> 02:07:54,010
and I lost a son.

1337
02:07:54,746 --> 02:07:58,341
We're quits,
and if Tattaglia agrees...

1338
02:07:58,450 --> 02:08:02,511
then I'm willing to let things
go on the way they were before.

1339
02:08:04,156 --> 02:08:07,683
We are all grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

1340
02:08:07,793 --> 02:08:10,489
We all know him
as a man of his word.

1341
02:08:10,595 --> 02:08:12,807
A modest man.
He'll always listen to reason.

1342
02:08:12,831 --> 02:08:15,331
Yes, Don Barzini.

1343
02:08:15,367 --> 02:08:17,412
He's too modest.

1344
02:08:17,436 --> 02:08:20,405
He had all the judges
and politicians in his pocket.

1345
02:08:21,807 --> 02:08:24,640
He refused to share them.

1346
02:08:24,743 --> 02:08:27,735
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1347
02:08:28,613 --> 02:08:31,113
All of you know me here.

1348
02:08:31,983 --> 02:08:36,010
When did I ever refuse,
except one time?

1349
02:08:36,121 --> 02:08:38,621
And why?

1350
02:08:38,790 --> 02:08:41,290
Because I believe
this drug business...

1351
02:08:41,393 --> 02:08:44,521
is going to destroy us
in the years to come.

1352
02:08:44,629 --> 02:08:48,360
I mean, it's not like gambling
or liquor or even women...

1353
02:08:48,467 --> 02:08:51,197
which is something that
most people want nowadays...

1354
02:08:51,303 --> 02:08:54,761
and is forbidden to them by
the pezzonovante of the church.

1355
02:08:54,873 --> 02:08:57,967
Even the police departments
that have helped us in the past...

1356
02:08:58,076 --> 02:08:59,887
with gambling and other things...

1357
02:08:59,911 --> 02:09:04,041
are gonna refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1358
02:09:04,149 --> 02:09:07,084
And I believed that then...

1359
02:09:07,185 --> 02:09:09,297
and I believe that now.

1360
02:09:09,321 --> 02:09:11,599
Times have changed.

1361
02:09:11,623 --> 02:09:13,868
It's not like the old days...

1362
02:09:13,892 --> 02:09:16,392
when we could do
anything we want.

1363
02:09:16,428 --> 02:09:19,329
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1364
02:09:19,431 --> 02:09:23,367
If Don Corleone had all the judges
and the politicians in New York...

1365
02:09:23,468 --> 02:09:26,460
then he must share them
or let others use them.

1366
02:09:26,571 --> 02:09:29,734
He must let us draw
the water from the well.

1367
02:09:30,675 --> 02:09:34,236
Certainly, he can present a bill
for such services.

1368
02:09:34,346 --> 02:09:37,076
After all, we are not Communists.

1369
02:09:40,051 --> 02:09:43,111
I also don't believe in drugs.

1370
02:09:43,221 --> 02:09:45,433
For years,
I paid my people extra...

1371
02:09:45,457 --> 02:09:47,835
so they wouldn't do
that kind of business.

1372
02:09:47,859 --> 02:09:51,295
Somebody comes to them and says,
"I have powders.

1373
02:09:51,396 --> 02:09:54,126
If you put up a three, four
thousand dollar investment,

1374
02:09:55,100 --> 02:09:57,762
we can make 50,000 distributing."

1375
02:09:58,870 --> 02:10:02,670
So they can't resist. I want
to control it as a business...

1376
02:10:02,774 --> 02:10:05,219
to keep it respectable.

1377
02:10:05,243 --> 02:10:09,771
I don't want it near schools.
I don't want it sold to children.

1378
02:10:09,881 --> 02:10:12,381
That's an infamia.

1379
02:10:12,918 --> 02:10:16,854
In my city, we would keep the traffic
in the dark people, the colored.

1380
02:10:16,955 --> 02:10:19,822
They're animals anyway,
so let them lose their souls.

1381
02:10:26,798 --> 02:10:30,097
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1382
02:10:31,836 --> 02:10:34,999
And as a reasonable man, I'm willing
to do whatever's necessary...

1383
02:10:35,106 --> 02:10:38,598
to find a peaceful solution
to these problems.

1384
02:10:38,710 --> 02:10:40,855
Then we are agreed.

1385
02:10:40,879 --> 02:10:43,291
The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1386
02:10:43,315 --> 02:10:45,875
And Don Corleone will give our
protection in the east...

1387
02:10:45,984 --> 02:10:47,895
and there will be the peace.

1388
02:10:47,919 --> 02:10:51,787
But I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1389
02:10:51,890 --> 02:10:55,053
As time goes by and
his position becomes stronger...

1390
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:57,685
will he attempt
any individual vendetta?

1391
02:10:57,796 --> 02:10:59,840
Look, we are all
reasonable men here.

1392
02:10:59,864 --> 02:11:03,300
We don't have to give assurances
as if we were lawyers.

1393
02:11:03,401 --> 02:11:05,613
You talk about vengeance.

1394
02:11:05,637 --> 02:11:08,902
Is vengeance gonna bring
your son back to you?

1395
02:11:09,007 --> 02:11:11,507
Or my boy to me?

1396
02:11:12,177 --> 02:11:14,677
I forego the vengeance of my son.

1397
02:11:17,816 --> 02:11:20,316
But I have selfish reasons.

1398
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:24,332
My youngest son...

1399
02:11:24,356 --> 02:11:26,856
was forced to leave this country...

1400
02:11:27,859 --> 02:11:30,359
because of this Sollozzo business.

1401
02:11:30,829 --> 02:11:33,662
All right.
And I have to make arrangements...

1402
02:11:33,765 --> 02:11:38,395
to bring him back here safely,
cleared of all these false charges.

1403
02:11:40,038 --> 02:11:43,064
But I'm a superstitious man.

1404
02:11:43,174 --> 02:11:45,734
And if some unlucky accident
should befall him...

1405
02:11:45,844 --> 02:11:49,575
if he should get shot
in the head by a police officer...

1406
02:11:49,681 --> 02:11:53,515
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell...

1407
02:11:53,618 --> 02:11:56,118
of if he's struck
by a bolt of lightening...

1408
02:11:57,756 --> 02:12:00,782
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1409
02:12:02,994 --> 02:12:05,494
And that I do not forgive.

1410
02:12:07,832 --> 02:12:10,332
But that aside...

1411
02:12:13,271 --> 02:12:15,771
let me say that I swear...

1412
02:12:17,208 --> 02:12:20,302
on the souls of my grandchildren...

1413
02:12:20,412 --> 02:12:23,939
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1414
02:12:50,341 --> 02:12:52,581
When I meet with the Tattaglia
people, should I insist...

1415
02:12:52,605 --> 02:12:55,710
that all these drug middlemen
have clean records?

1416
02:12:55,814 --> 02:12:58,314
Mention it. Don't insist.

1417
02:13:00,151 --> 02:13:02,651
Barzini is a man who'll know that
without being told.

1418
02:13:03,988 --> 02:13:06,582
You mean Tattaglia.

1419
02:13:06,691 --> 02:13:09,421
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1420
02:13:09,527 --> 02:13:12,027
He never could've outfought Santino.

1421
02:13:15,366 --> 02:13:19,029
But I didn't know until this day
that it was...

1422
02:13:19,137 --> 02:13:21,637
Barzini all along.

1423
02:13:36,287 --> 02:13:38,787
Come on, Nancy.

1424
02:13:39,491 --> 02:13:41,991
Keep together, everyone. Brian?

1425
02:13:43,361 --> 02:13:45,861
Okay. All right.

1426
02:13:58,409 --> 02:14:00,934
How long have you been back?

1427
02:14:01,045 --> 02:14:03,545
I've been back a year.

1428
02:14:04,482 --> 02:14:07,007
Longer than that, I think.

1429
02:14:09,254 --> 02:14:11,754
It's good to see you, Kay.

1430
02:14:17,662 --> 02:14:20,162
Hi, Miss Adams!

1431
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:25,000
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1432
02:14:27,639 --> 02:14:29,650
He's been sick.

1433
02:14:29,674 --> 02:14:32,086
Very sick.

1434
02:14:32,110 --> 02:14:34,188
But you're not like him, Michael.

1435
02:14:34,212 --> 02:14:36,737
I thought you weren't going
to become a man like your father.

1436
02:14:36,848 --> 02:14:39,348
That's what you told me.

1437
02:14:39,884 --> 02:14:42,614
My father's no different
than any other powerful man.

1438
02:14:44,289 --> 02:14:47,850
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1439
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:51,438
Like a senator or a president.

1440
02:14:51,462 --> 02:14:53,987
- Do you know how naive you sound?
- Why?

1441
02:14:54,098 --> 02:14:56,692
Senators and presidents
don't have men killed.

1442
02:14:58,037 --> 02:14:59,037
Oh.

1443
02:15:00,038 --> 02:15:02,538
Who's being naive, Kay?

1444
02:15:03,174 --> 02:15:05,386
Kay, my father's way
of doing things is over.

1445
02:15:05,410 --> 02:15:08,902
It's finished.
Even he knows that.

1446
02:15:09,013 --> 02:15:11,025
I mean, in five years
the Corleone family...

1447
02:15:11,049 --> 02:15:13,549
is going to be completely legitimate.

1448
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:18,164
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business.

1449
02:15:18,188 --> 02:15:19,188
Kay.

1450
02:15:20,658 --> 02:15:23,003
Michael, why did you come here?

1451
02:15:23,027 --> 02:15:25,206
Why?

1452
02:15:25,230 --> 02:15:27,274
What do you want with me
after all this time...

1453
02:15:27,298 --> 02:15:29,823
without even calling or writing?

1454
02:15:29,934 --> 02:15:31,912
I came here because I need you.

1455
02:15:31,936 --> 02:15:34,461
- Because I care for you.
- Please stop it, Michael.

1456
02:15:34,572 --> 02:15:37,700
Because I want you to marry me.

1457
02:15:39,210 --> 02:15:41,710
- It's too late. It's too late.
- Please. Kay.

1458
02:15:43,414 --> 02:15:47,282
I'll do anything you ask, anything to
make up for what's happened to us.

1459
02:15:49,087 --> 02:15:51,398
Because that's important, Kay.

1460
02:15:51,422 --> 02:15:54,914
Because what's important is that...

1461
02:15:55,026 --> 02:15:56,837
we have each other.

1462
02:15:56,861 --> 02:15:59,762
That we have a life together.

1463
02:15:59,864 --> 02:16:03,322
That we have children.
Our children.

1464
02:16:03,823 --> 02:16:04,823
Kay...

1465
02:16:05,470 --> 02:16:08,200
I need you...

1466
02:16:08,306 --> 02:16:10,806
and I love you.

1467
02:16:31,930 --> 02:16:33,908
Barzini's people
chisel my territory...

1468
02:16:33,932 --> 02:16:35,776
and we do nothing about it.

1469
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:38,481
Pretty soon, there won't be one place
in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

1470
02:16:38,536 --> 02:16:41,061
- Just be patient.
- I'm not askin' you for help, Mike.

1471
02:16:41,172 --> 02:16:43,697
- Just take off the handcuffs.
- Be patient.

1472
02:16:43,808 --> 02:16:45,920
We gotta protect ourselves.

1473
02:16:45,944 --> 02:16:47,922
Give me a chance to recruit
some new men.

1474
02:16:47,946 --> 02:16:49,556
No.

1475
02:16:49,580 --> 02:16:52,080
I don't wanna give Barzini
an excuse to start fighting.

1476
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:54,675
Mike, you're wrong.

1477
02:16:54,786 --> 02:16:58,415
Don Corleone, you once said that the day would come...

1478
02:16:58,523 --> 02:17:01,219
when Tessio and me
could form our own family.

1479
02:17:01,326 --> 02:17:03,304
Till today,
I would never think of it.

1480
02:17:03,328 --> 02:17:05,673
I must ask your permission.

1481
02:17:05,697 --> 02:17:08,928
Well, Michael is now
head of the family...

1482
02:17:09,033 --> 02:17:11,729
and if he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1483
02:17:13,304 --> 02:17:15,804
After we make the move to Nevada...

1484
02:17:15,907 --> 02:17:18,899
you can break off from the Corleone
family and go on your own.

1485
02:17:19,010 --> 02:17:21,808
- After we make the move to Nevada.
- How long will that be?

1486
02:17:23,047 --> 02:17:24,658
Six months.

1487
02:17:24,682 --> 02:17:28,140
Forgive me, Godfather,
but with you gone...

1488
02:17:28,252 --> 02:17:31,221
me and Pete'll come under
Barzini's thumb sooner or later.

1489
02:17:31,322 --> 02:17:33,822
And I hate that goddamn Barzini.

1490
02:17:33,858 --> 02:17:36,793
In six months' time, there won't be
nothing left to build on.

1491
02:17:36,894 --> 02:17:39,886
- You have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1492
02:17:39,998 --> 02:17:42,796
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Yes, always, Godfather.

1493
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:45,145
Then be a friend to Michael...

1494
02:17:45,169 --> 02:17:47,669
and do as he says.

1495
02:17:51,109 --> 02:17:53,629
There are things being negotiated
now that are going to solve...

1496
02:17:53,653 --> 02:17:56,405
all your problems
and answer all your questions.

1497
02:17:56,514 --> 02:17:59,014
That's all I can tell you now.

1498
02:17:59,517 --> 02:18:02,145
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1499
02:18:02,253 --> 02:18:05,416
When we make our move there,
you're gonna be my right-hand man.

1500
02:18:05,523 --> 02:18:08,219
Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.

1501
02:18:08,326 --> 02:18:10,804
He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.

1502
02:18:10,828 --> 02:18:13,273
That's no reflection on Tom,
but that's the way I want it.

1503
02:18:13,297 --> 02:18:15,209
Besides, if I ever need help...

1504
02:18:15,233 --> 02:18:17,511
who's a better consigliere
than my father?

1505
02:18:17,535 --> 02:18:20,035
Now that's it.

1506
02:18:38,122 --> 02:18:40,622
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1507
02:18:42,028 --> 02:18:46,258
Mike, ehh... Why am I out?

1508
02:18:46,364 --> 02:18:48,864
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1509
02:18:50,435 --> 02:18:52,935
Things may get rough
with the move we're trying.

1510
02:18:53,636 --> 02:18:54,636
Tom...

1511
02:19:00,211 --> 02:19:02,456
I advised Michael.

1512
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:05,381
I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1513
02:19:05,483 --> 02:19:08,748
I thought Santino was a bad Don...

1514
02:19:08,853 --> 02:19:11,098
rest in peace.

1515
02:19:11,122 --> 02:19:14,148
Michael has all my confidence,
as, as you do.

1516
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:18,886
But there are reasons why
you must have no part...

1517
02:19:18,996 --> 02:19:21,208
in what is going to happen.

1518
02:19:21,232 --> 02:19:22,709
Maybe I could help.

1519
02:19:22,733 --> 02:19:25,233
You're out, Tom.

1520
02:20:13,651 --> 02:20:16,176
I can't get over the way
your face looks.

1521
02:20:16,287 --> 02:20:19,450
It really looks good.
This doctor did some job.

1522
02:20:19,557 --> 02:20:22,185
Who talked you into it, Kay?
Hey, hey, wait.

1523
02:20:22,293 --> 02:20:24,671
Leave them out here.
We'll deal with them later.

1524
02:20:24,695 --> 02:20:26,673
He's tired.
He wants to clean up.

1525
02:20:26,697 --> 02:20:29,757
For right now, let me open the door.
All right?

1526
02:20:35,306 --> 02:20:37,618
Hello, Mike.
Welcome to Las Vegas.

1527
02:20:37,642 --> 02:20:40,907
All for you, kid.
It was all his idea, right?

1528
02:20:41,012 --> 02:20:43,810
- Well, your brother, Freddy...
- It was... Girls?

1529
02:20:47,552 --> 02:20:50,350
I'll be right back.
You keep them occupied.

1530
02:20:50,454 --> 02:20:53,389
That a boy.
Anything you want, kid, anything. Huh?

1531
02:20:53,491 --> 02:20:55,991
Who are the girls?

1532
02:20:56,561 --> 02:20:58,539
That's for you to find out.

1533
02:20:58,563 --> 02:21:01,430
Get rid of them, Fredo.

1534
02:21:01,532 --> 02:21:03,644
- Hey, Mike...
- Fredo, I'm here on business.

1535
02:21:03,668 --> 02:21:07,399
I leave tomorrow.
Now, get rid of them. I'm tired.

1536
02:21:07,505 --> 02:21:10,005
Get rid of the band too.

1537
02:21:14,979 --> 02:21:17,777
Hey, just take off.
Come on. Let's go.

1538
02:21:17,882 --> 02:21:21,147
Hey, that's it.
Hey, Angelo, that's it.

1539
02:21:21,252 --> 02:21:23,263
Let's go. Hey, come on!

1540
02:21:23,287 --> 02:21:25,787
Scram!

1541
02:21:26,057 --> 02:21:28,402
Come on, honey. Let's go.
I don't know, Johnny.

1542
02:21:28,426 --> 02:21:30,786
I don't know what the hell's
the matter with him. I'm sorry.

1543
02:21:30,810 --> 02:21:32,873
It's all right, Freddy.

1544
02:21:32,897 --> 02:21:35,397
I don't know.
He's tired, he's hot.

1545
02:21:42,406 --> 02:21:44,906
What happened to Moe Greene?

1546
02:21:45,509 --> 02:21:47,988
He said he had some business.
He said give him a call...

1547
02:21:48,012 --> 02:21:49,957
when the party started.

1548
02:21:49,981 --> 02:21:52,481
Well, give him a call.

1549
02:21:53,284 --> 02:21:56,378
- Johnny, how are you?
- Hello, Mike. Nice to see you again.

1550
02:21:56,487 --> 02:21:58,632
- We're all proud of you.
- Thanks, Mike.

1551
02:21:58,656 --> 02:22:01,034
Sit down, Johnny.
I want to talk to you.

1552
02:22:01,058 --> 02:22:05,495
- The Don's proud of you, too, Johnny.
- Well, I, owe it all to him.

1553
02:22:05,596 --> 02:22:07,608
Well, he knows
how grateful you are.

1554
02:22:07,632 --> 02:22:10,692
That's why he'd like to ask
a favor of you.

1555
02:22:10,801 --> 02:22:13,301
Mike, what can I do?

1556
02:22:14,090 --> 02:22:16,650
The Corleone family is thinking
of giving up all its interests...

1557
02:22:16,674 --> 02:22:20,075
in the olive oil business,
settling out here.

1558
02:22:20,177 --> 02:22:23,442
Now, Moe Greene will sell us his
share of the casino and the hotel...

1559
02:22:23,547 --> 02:22:26,141
so it can be completely owned
by the family. Tom?

1560
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:28,528
Hey, Mike, are you sure about that?

1561
02:22:28,552 --> 02:22:31,419
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothin' to me about sellin'.

1562
02:22:31,522 --> 02:22:34,022
Well, I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

1563
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:38,171
See, Johnny...

1564
02:22:38,195 --> 02:22:40,474
see, we figure that entertainment
will be a big factor...

1565
02:22:40,498 --> 02:22:42,276
in drawing gamblers to the casino.

1566
02:22:42,300 --> 02:22:45,599
Now we hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1567
02:22:49,106 --> 02:22:52,371
Perhaps convince some of
your friends in the movies...

1568
02:22:52,476 --> 02:22:54,976
to do the same.

1569
02:22:55,046 --> 02:22:57,546
We're counting on you.

1570
02:22:59,150 --> 02:23:01,675
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1571
02:23:01,786 --> 02:23:03,096
You know that.

1572
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:05,620
Good.

1573
02:23:05,756 --> 02:23:07,968
Hey, Mike. Hello, fellas.

1574
02:23:07,992 --> 02:23:11,689
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
Good to see you, Mike.

1575
02:23:11,796 --> 02:23:13,807
- How are you, Moe?
- You got everything you want?

1576
02:23:13,831 --> 02:23:16,711
The chef cooked for you special, the
dancers will kick your tongue out...

1577
02:23:16,735 --> 02:23:18,378
and your credit is good.

1578
02:23:18,402 --> 02:23:21,043
Draw chips for everybody in the room
so they can play on the house.

1579
02:23:24,608 --> 02:23:27,108
My credit good enough
to buy you out?

1580
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:30,991
Buy me out?

1581
02:23:31,015 --> 02:23:33,677
The casino. The hotel.

1582
02:23:33,784 --> 02:23:36,548
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1583
02:23:36,654 --> 02:23:39,521
The Corleone family
wants to buy me out?

1584
02:23:39,623 --> 02:23:42,123
No, I buy you out.
You don't buy me out.

1585
02:23:42,159 --> 02:23:45,424
Your casino loses money.
Maybe we can do better.

1586
02:23:45,529 --> 02:23:48,029
You think I'm skimming
off the top, Mike?

1587
02:23:48,833 --> 02:23:51,333
You're unlucky.

1588
02:23:54,505 --> 02:23:56,950
You goddamn guineas
really make me laugh.

1589
02:23:56,974 --> 02:23:59,807
I do you a favor and take Freddy in
when you're having a bad time.

1590
02:23:59,910 --> 02:24:02,356
- And then you try to push me out!
- Wait a minute.

1591
02:24:02,380 --> 02:24:04,974
You took Freddy in because
the Corleone family...

1592
02:24:05,082 --> 02:24:07,582
bankrolled your casino,
because the Molinari family...

1593
02:24:07,685 --> 02:24:09,796
on the coast guaranteed his safety.

1594
02:24:09,820 --> 02:24:11,865
Now, we're talkin' business.
Let's talk business.

1595
02:24:11,889 --> 02:24:14,619
Yeah, let's talk business, Mike.
First of all, you're all done.

1596
02:24:14,702 --> 02:24:17,222
The Corleone family don't even have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1597
02:24:17,246 --> 02:24:19,966
The Godfather's sick, right? You're
getting chased out of New York...

1598
02:24:19,990 --> 02:24:21,508
by Barzini and the other families.

1599
02:24:21,532 --> 02:24:25,434
What do you think is going on here? You
think you can come to my hotel and take over?

1600
02:24:25,536 --> 02:24:27,347
I talked to Barzini.

1601
02:24:27,371 --> 02:24:30,636
I can make a deal with him
and still keep my hotel.

1602
02:24:30,741 --> 02:24:33,335
Is that why you slapped
my brother around in public?

1603
02:24:34,412 --> 02:24:36,113
Oh, no, that was nothin', Mike.

1604
02:24:36,414 --> 02:24:38,974
Now, now, Moe didn't mean nothin' by that.

1605
02:24:39,083 --> 02:24:41,561
Sure he flies off the handle
once in a while...

1606
02:24:41,585 --> 02:24:43,697
but Moe and me,
we're good friends, right, Moe, huh?

1607
02:24:43,721 --> 02:24:45,565
I got a business to run.

1608
02:24:45,589 --> 02:24:48,319
I gotta kick asses sometimes
to make it run right.

1609
02:24:48,426 --> 02:24:52,419
We had a little argument, Freddy and I,
so I had to straighten him out.

1610
02:24:52,530 --> 02:24:55,124
You straightened my brother out?

1611
02:24:55,232 --> 02:24:57,711
He was banging cocktail waitresses
two at a time!

1612
02:24:57,735 --> 02:25:00,636
Players couldn't get a drink at the table.
What's wrong with you?

1613
02:25:06,677 --> 02:25:10,169
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1614
02:25:10,281 --> 02:25:11,958
Son of a bitch.

1615
02:25:11,982 --> 02:25:15,008
Do you know who I am?
I'm Moe Greene.

1616
02:25:15,119 --> 02:25:17,713
I made my bones when you were
going out with cheerleaders.

1617
02:25:17,822 --> 02:25:20,322
Wait a minute, Moe.
Moe, I got an idea.

1618
02:25:21,325 --> 02:25:24,522
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Now, you can talk to the Don.

1619
02:25:24,628 --> 02:25:26,606
- You can explain...
- Just a minute.

1620
02:25:26,630 --> 02:25:30,225
The Don is semiretired and Mike is
in charge of the family business now.

1621
02:25:30,334 --> 02:25:32,894
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1622
02:25:37,776 --> 02:25:42,371
Mike! You don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1623
02:25:44,717 --> 02:25:49,447
Fredo. You're my older brother,
and I love you.

1624
02:25:50,955 --> 02:25:52,999
But don't ever take sides
with anyone...

1625
02:25:53,023 --> 02:25:55,924
against the family again...

1626
02:25:56,026 --> 02:25:58,526
ever.

1627
02:26:05,336 --> 02:26:07,481
I have to see my father
and his people.

1628
02:26:07,505 --> 02:26:10,005
- So have dinner without me.
- Oh, Michael.

1629
02:26:11,509 --> 02:26:13,753
This weekend we'll go out.
We'll go to the city.

1630
02:26:13,777 --> 02:26:16,277
We'll see a show and we'll have dinner.
I promise.

1631
02:26:23,721 --> 02:26:26,622
Oh, Michael. Michael, your sister wants
to ask you something.

1632
02:26:26,724 --> 02:26:28,835
- Well, let her ask.
- No, she's afraid to.

1633
02:26:28,859 --> 02:26:32,090
Connie and Carlo want you to be
godfather to their little boy.

1634
02:26:32,196 --> 02:26:34,040
- Oh, we'll see.
- Will you?

1635
02:26:34,064 --> 02:26:36,564
Let me think about it. We'll see.
Come on.

1636
02:26:43,173 --> 02:26:45,085
So...

1637
02:26:45,109 --> 02:26:48,078
Barzini will move against you first.

1638
02:26:48,178 --> 02:26:52,512
He'll set up a meeting with
someone that you absolutely trust...

1639
02:26:52,616 --> 02:26:55,116
guaranteeing your safety.

1640
02:26:55,953 --> 02:26:59,218
And at that meeting,
you'll be assassinated.

1641
02:27:03,861 --> 02:27:07,058
I like to drink wine
more than I used to.

1642
02:27:08,232 --> 02:27:10,377
Anyway, I'm drinking more.

1643
02:27:10,401 --> 02:27:12,901
It's good for you, Pop.

1644
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:19,340
I don't know.

1645
02:27:20,244 --> 02:27:22,744
Your wife and children,
are you happy with them?

1646
02:27:24,148 --> 02:27:26,192
Very happy.

1647
02:27:26,216 --> 02:27:28,741
That's good.

1648
02:27:28,852 --> 02:27:31,097
I hope you don't mind
the way I...

1649
02:27:31,121 --> 02:27:33,715
I keep going over
this Barzini business.

1650
02:27:33,824 --> 02:27:35,869
No, not at all.

1651
02:27:35,893 --> 02:27:38,238
It's an old habit.

1652
02:27:38,262 --> 02:27:41,026
I spent my life
tryin' not to be careless.

1653
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:45,733
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1654
02:27:49,607 --> 02:27:52,167
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1655
02:27:52,276 --> 02:27:54,776
You know, he looks
more like you every day.

1656
02:27:57,581 --> 02:27:59,826
He's smarter than I am.

1657
02:27:59,850 --> 02:28:02,350
Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.

1658
02:28:04,154 --> 02:28:06,654
Reads the funny papers.

1659
02:28:13,397 --> 02:28:15,875
I want you to arrange
to have a telephone man...

1660
02:28:15,899 --> 02:28:19,027
check all the calls that go
in and out of here.

1661
02:28:19,136 --> 02:28:21,247
- I did it already, Pop.
- Could be anyone.

1662
02:28:21,271 --> 02:28:24,798
- Pop, I took care of that.
- Oh, that's right. I forgot.

1663
02:28:28,512 --> 02:28:30,890
What's the matter?

1664
02:28:30,914 --> 02:28:33,414
What's bothering you?

1665
02:28:36,186 --> 02:28:38,686
I'll handle it.

1666
02:28:39,089 --> 02:28:41,589
I told you I can handle it,
I'll handle it.

1667
02:28:54,638 --> 02:28:58,972
I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this...

1668
02:28:59,076 --> 02:29:00,954
and Fredo...

1669
02:29:00,978 --> 02:29:03,423
Well...

1670
02:29:03,447 --> 02:29:05,947
Fredo was...

1671
02:29:07,484 --> 02:29:10,248
But I never, I never wanted this for you.

1672
02:29:12,523 --> 02:29:15,356
I worked my whole life...
I don't apologize...

1673
02:29:15,459 --> 02:29:17,604
to take care of my family...

1674
02:29:17,628 --> 02:29:21,496
and I refused to be a fool...

1675
02:29:21,598 --> 02:29:25,659
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1676
02:29:27,771 --> 02:29:30,934
I don't apologize. That's my life.
But I thought that...

1677
02:29:32,910 --> 02:29:35,504
that when it was your time...

1678
02:29:35,612 --> 02:29:38,112
that you would be the one
to hold the strings.

1679
02:29:39,950 --> 02:29:42,450
Senator Corleone.

1680
02:29:43,420 --> 02:29:45,565
Governor Corleone. Something.

1681
02:29:45,589 --> 02:29:48,089
Another pezzonovante.

1682
02:29:53,597 --> 02:29:57,431
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1683
02:29:57,534 --> 02:30:00,128
We'll get there, Pop.

1684
02:30:00,237 --> 02:30:02,737
We'll get there.

1685
02:30:05,976 --> 02:30:10,345
Now listen. Whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting...

1686
02:30:10,447 --> 02:30:12,192
he's the traitor.

1687
02:30:12,216 --> 02:30:14,716
Don't forget that.

1688
02:30:30,467 --> 02:30:32,967
Put it over the tree.

1689
02:30:47,751 --> 02:30:50,196
- Can I water these?
- Yeah.

1690
02:30:50,220 --> 02:30:51,765
That's fine.

1691
02:30:51,789 --> 02:30:54,289
Over here. Over here.

1692
02:30:56,393 --> 02:30:58,893
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1693
02:31:05,202 --> 02:31:07,702
Anthony, come here.

1694
02:31:13,110 --> 02:31:15,610
Go ahead. That's right.
We'll put it right there.

1695
02:31:21,418 --> 02:31:23,918
I'll show you something.
Come here.

1696
02:31:26,423 --> 02:31:28,923
Now, you stand there.

1697
02:31:32,029 --> 02:31:34,529
Give me an orange!

1698
02:31:52,115 --> 02:31:54,615
That's a new trick.

1699
02:31:55,185 --> 02:31:57,745
You run in there. Run in there.

1700
02:32:10,367 --> 02:32:12,867
- Where are you?
- Who?

1701
02:32:46,003 --> 02:32:48,503
Ouch!

1702
02:35:10,047 --> 02:35:12,547
Mike, can I have a minute?

1703
02:35:22,893 --> 02:35:25,338
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1704
02:35:25,362 --> 02:35:27,862
He says we can straighten
any of our problems out.

1705
02:35:29,533 --> 02:35:32,033
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1706
02:35:32,969 --> 02:35:35,381
I can arrange security...

1707
02:35:35,405 --> 02:35:37,905
on my territory.

1708
02:35:39,843 --> 02:35:41,821
All right?

1709
02:35:41,845 --> 02:35:44,678
- All right.
- All right.

1710
02:35:59,963 --> 02:36:02,463
Do you know how
they're gonna come at you?

1711
02:36:05,402 --> 02:36:07,814
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn.

1712
02:36:07,838 --> 02:36:10,338
Tessio's ground...

1713
02:36:11,208 --> 02:36:13,708
where I'll be safe.

1714
02:36:25,255 --> 02:36:28,850
I always thought it would've been
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1715
02:36:28,959 --> 02:36:31,304
It's the smart move.

1716
02:36:31,328 --> 02:36:33,828
Tessio was always smarter.

1717
02:36:35,031 --> 02:36:37,310
But I'm gonna wait.

1718
02:36:37,334 --> 02:36:39,834
After the baptism.

1719
02:36:41,805 --> 02:36:44,365
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1720
02:36:45,709 --> 02:36:48,644
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini...

1721
02:36:48,745 --> 02:36:51,190
and Tattaglia...

1722
02:36:51,214 --> 02:36:53,714
all the heads
of the five families.

1723
02:37:20,215 --> 02:37:22,215
Go forth from him, unclean spirit,

1724
02:37:22,416 --> 02:37:25,616
and give place to the Holy Spirit,
the Spirit of God.

1725
02:37:27,594 --> 02:37:28,594
Let us pray.

1726
02:37:28,618 --> 02:37:31,618
Our prayers through through
Christ our Lord. So be it.

1727
02:37:32,196 --> 02:37:33,196
Michael.

1728
02:37:33,220 --> 02:37:36,220
Signed with the sign of the Lord's cross,

1729
02:37:37,221 --> 02:37:40,198
so that, preserving this first experience
of the greatness of thy glory,

1730
02:37:40,222 --> 02:37:43,199
he may deserve, by keeping
thy commandments,

1731
02:37:43,223 --> 02:37:46,200
<i>to attain to the glory of regeneration.</i>

1732
02:37:46,224 --> 02:37:49,201
<i>Through Christ our Lord. So be it.</i>

1733
02:37:49,225 --> 02:37:52,202
<i>Let us pray.
Almighty, everlasting God,</i>

1734
02:37:52,226 --> 02:37:54,703
<i>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i>

1735
02:37:54,727 --> 02:37:57,704
<i>look graciously down upon this,
thy servant, Michael.</i>

1736
02:37:57,728 --> 02:38:00,705
Who shall come to judge the living
and the dead,

1737
02:38:00,729 --> 02:38:03,706
and the world by fire. So be it.

1738
02:38:03,730 --> 02:38:06,007
Michael. Receive the salt of wisdom.

1739
02:38:06,031 --> 02:38:08,308
Let it be to thee a token of mercy
unto everlasting life.

1740
02:38:08,332 --> 02:38:10,372
May it make your way easy to eternal life.
So be it.

1741
02:38:10,396 --> 02:38:12,810
May the almighty God, the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

1742
02:38:12,834 --> 02:38:15,334
<i>Who hath regenerated thee by water
and the Holy Spirit,</i>

1743
02:38:16,335 --> 02:38:18,835
<i>and who hath given thee the
remission of all thy sins,</i>

1744
02:38:19,336 --> 02:38:22,813
<i>may he, himself anoint thee with
the Chrism of Salvation,</i>

1745
02:38:22,837 --> 02:38:25,837
<i>in the same Christ Jesus our Lord,
unto life eternal. So be it.</i>

1746
02:38:26,838 --> 02:38:30,138
I annoint you with the oil of salvation
in Christ Jesus our Lord,

1747
02:38:30,439 --> 02:38:33,439
that you may have everlasting life.
So be it.

1748
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:43,817
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1749
02:38:43,841 --> 02:38:46,818
<i>the communion of Saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1750
02:38:46,842 --> 02:38:50,342
<i>the resurrection of the body
and life everlasting? I do believe.</i>

1751
02:38:51,343 --> 02:38:54,320
I exorcise thee, unclean spirit,
in the name of the Father,

1752
02:38:54,344 --> 02:38:57,321
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

1753
02:38:57,345 --> 02:39:01,322
that thou goest out and depart from
this servant of God, Michael.

1754
02:39:01,346 --> 02:39:04,846
For he commands thee, accursed one,

1755
02:39:06,647 --> 02:39:09,624
Be opened, for an odor of sweetness.

1756
02:39:09,648 --> 02:39:12,625
Be thou, devil, begone,

1757
02:39:12,649 --> 02:39:14,949
for the judgment of God shall draw near.

1758
02:39:14,991 --> 02:39:17,892
Michael, do you believe in God,
the Father almighty...

1759
02:39:17,994 --> 02:39:20,963
- creator of Heaven and Earth?
- I do.

1760
02:39:21,064 --> 02:39:24,363
<i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
his only Son, our Lord?</i>

1761
02:39:24,467 --> 02:39:25,945
<i>I do.</i>

1762
02:39:25,969 --> 02:39:30,116
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?</i>

1763
02:39:30,140 --> 02:39:31,140
<i>I do.</i>

1764
02:39:31,441 --> 02:39:35,318
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.</i>

1765
02:39:35,342 --> 02:39:39,319
<i>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

1766
02:39:39,343 --> 02:39:42,120
<i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i>

1767
02:39:42,144 --> 02:39:44,144
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

1768
02:39:44,345 --> 02:39:47,415
<i>as we forgive them that
trespass against us.</i>

1769
02:39:47,439 --> 02:39:50,416
<i>And lead us not into temptation,</i>

1770
02:39:50,440 --> 02:39:52,417
<i>but deliver us from evil.
So be it.</i>

1771
02:39:52,441 --> 02:39:53,918
Michael.

1772
02:39:53,942 --> 02:39:56,919
Enter thou into the temple of God,

1773
02:39:56,943 --> 02:39:59,920
that thou mayest have part with Christ
unto life everlasting. So be it.

1774
02:39:59,944 --> 02:40:02,421
I believe in God the Father almighty,

1775
02:40:02,445 --> 02:40:04,422
Creator of heaven and earth,

1776
02:40:04,446 --> 02:40:07,923
<i>and in Jesus Christ his only
son our Lord,</i>

1777
02:40:07,947 --> 02:40:10,224
<i>who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,</i>

1778
02:40:10,248 --> 02:40:12,225
<i>born of the Virgin Mary,</i>

1779
02:40:12,249 --> 02:40:15,527
<i>suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, dead, and buried.</i>

1780
02:40:15,551 --> 02:40:18,228
<i>He descended into Hell.
On the third day,</i>

1781
02:40:18,252 --> 02:40:22,229
<i>He rose again from the dead.
He ascended into heaven,</i>

1782
02:40:22,253 --> 02:40:25,030
<i>and sitteth at the right hand of
God the Father almighty,</i>

1783
02:40:25,054 --> 02:40:27,531
<i>from thence shall he come to judge
the living and the dead.</i>

1784
02:40:27,555 --> 02:40:30,532
<i>I believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1785
02:40:30,556 --> 02:40:33,533
<i>the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1786
02:40:33,557 --> 02:40:36,357
<i>the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. So be it.</i>

1787
02:40:36,439 --> 02:40:41,376
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1788
02:40:47,784 --> 02:40:50,284
I do renounce him.

1789
02:40:58,595 --> 02:41:01,095
And all his works?

1790
02:41:13,309 --> 02:41:15,809
I do renounce them.

1791
02:41:20,683 --> 02:41:24,642
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1792
02:41:40,036 --> 02:41:44,097
Michael Rizzi,
will you be baptized?

1793
02:41:44,207 --> 02:41:46,184
I will.

1794
02:41:46,208 --> 02:41:48,485
In the name of the Father,

1795
02:41:48,509 --> 02:41:50,486
<i>and of the Son,</i>

1796
02:41:50,510 --> 02:41:52,910
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

1797
02:41:53,249 --> 02:41:55,809
<i>Michael Rizzi, go in peace.</i>

1798
02:41:55,919 --> 02:41:58,945
And may the Lord be with you.
So be it.

1799
02:42:41,064 --> 02:42:43,042
- Carlo.
- What?

1800
02:42:43,066 --> 02:42:45,277
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1801
02:42:45,301 --> 02:42:47,313
Everybody's gonna have to leave
without us.

1802
02:42:47,337 --> 02:42:49,897
- It's our first vacation together.
- Connie, please.

1803
02:42:50,006 --> 02:42:51,984
- What do you wanna do?
- Go back to the house.

1804
02:42:52,008 --> 02:42:54,875
Wait for my call.
It's important.

1805
02:42:54,978 --> 02:42:57,478
I'll only be a couple of days.

1806
02:42:59,916 --> 02:43:02,416
Have a nice trip, Mama.

1807
02:43:13,429 --> 02:43:15,929
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1808
02:43:17,767 --> 02:43:20,145
I hope Mike can get us
a good deal tonight.

1809
02:43:20,169 --> 02:43:22,669
I'm sure he will.

1810
02:43:29,412 --> 02:43:32,438
Sal, Tom, the boss says
he'll come in a separate car.

1811
02:43:32,549 --> 02:43:34,727
He says for you two
to go on ahead.

1812
02:43:34,751 --> 02:43:37,379
Hell, he can't do that.
It screws up all my arrangements.

1813
02:43:37,487 --> 02:43:39,987
- Well that's what he said.
- I can't go either, Sal.

1814
02:43:52,602 --> 02:43:55,366
Tell Mike it was only business.

1815
02:43:55,471 --> 02:43:57,971
I always liked him.

1816
02:43:58,141 --> 02:44:00,641
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1817
02:44:07,050 --> 02:44:09,550
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1818
02:44:10,653 --> 02:44:13,349
- For old times' sake.
- Can't do it, Sally.

1819
02:44:59,302 --> 02:45:01,802
You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.

1820
02:45:06,709 --> 02:45:08,520
Mike, you got it all wrong.

1821
02:45:08,544 --> 02:45:11,044
You fingered Sonny
for the Barzini people.

1822
02:45:12,649 --> 02:45:15,709
That little farce you played
with my sister.

1823
02:45:15,818 --> 02:45:17,796
Did you think that could fool
a Corleone?

1824
02:45:17,820 --> 02:45:20,983
Mike, I'm innocent.
I swear on the kids.

1825
02:45:21,090 --> 02:45:23,590
- Please, don't do this to me.
- Sit down.

1826
02:45:26,729 --> 02:45:29,229
Don't do this to me, please.

1827
02:45:38,107 --> 02:45:40,607
Barzini's dead.

1828
02:45:41,778 --> 02:45:44,278
So is Phillip Tattaglia...

1829
02:45:45,481 --> 02:45:47,960
Moe Greene...

1830
02:45:47,984 --> 02:45:50,484
Stracci...

1831
02:45:51,054 --> 02:45:53,554
Cuneo.

1832
02:45:53,623 --> 02:45:57,115
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1833
02:45:58,995 --> 02:46:01,495
Admit what you did.

1834
02:46:04,634 --> 02:46:07,134
Get him a drink.

1835
02:46:12,775 --> 02:46:15,187
Come on.

1836
02:46:15,211 --> 02:46:17,589
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1837
02:46:17,613 --> 02:46:20,113
Come on. You think I'd make my sister
a widow?

1838
02:46:21,751 --> 02:46:24,251
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1839
02:46:31,394 --> 02:46:32,705
Go ahead, drink.

1840
02:46:32,729 --> 02:46:35,229
Drink.

1841
02:46:38,301 --> 02:46:40,446
Now, Carlo, you're out
of the family business.

1842
02:46:40,470 --> 02:46:44,133
That's your punishment.
You're finished.

1843
02:46:44,240 --> 02:46:46,740
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1844
02:46:52,982 --> 02:46:56,383
I want you to stay there.
Understand?

1845
02:46:56,486 --> 02:46:58,986
Only don't tell me
you're innocent...

1846
02:47:00,556 --> 02:47:03,525
because it insults my intelligence.

1847
02:47:03,626 --> 02:47:06,126
It makes me very angry.

1848
02:47:09,031 --> 02:47:12,262
Now, who approached you?

1849
02:47:12,368 --> 02:47:14,868
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1850
02:47:22,011 --> 02:47:24,511
It was Barzini.

1851
02:47:26,949 --> 02:47:29,449
Good.

1852
02:47:36,092 --> 02:47:38,754
There's a car waiting for you
outside to take you to the airport.

1853
02:47:40,196 --> 02:47:42,696
I'll call your wife,
tell her what flight you're on.

1854
02:47:48,304 --> 02:47:50,804
- Please, can I...
- Get out of my sight.

1855
02:48:16,265 --> 02:48:18,765
Hello, Carlo.

1856
02:49:15,291 --> 02:49:18,089
Will you stop crying?
What are you trying to tell me?

1857
02:49:18,194 --> 02:49:20,992
- I'm trying to tell you you're wrong.
- Mama, please!

1858
02:49:29,407 --> 02:49:31,407
Michael! Michael!

1859
02:49:31,908 --> 02:49:34,408
Where is he?

1860
02:49:36,312 --> 02:49:41,340
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband!

1861
02:49:41,450 --> 02:49:44,044
You waited until Papa died
so nobody could stop you...

1862
02:49:44,153 --> 02:49:45,664
and then you killed him!

1863
02:49:45,688 --> 02:49:48,816
You blamed him for Sonny.
You always did. Everybody did.

1864
02:49:48,925 --> 02:49:52,554
But you never thought about me!
You never gave a damn about me!

1865
02:49:52,662 --> 02:49:55,162
Now what am I gonna do?

1866
02:49:58,868 --> 02:50:01,368
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the mall?

1867
02:50:01,437 --> 02:50:03,997
All the time he knew
he was gonna kill him.

1868
02:50:04,106 --> 02:50:07,200
And you stood godfather
to our baby.

1869
02:50:07,310 --> 02:50:09,621
You lousy, coldhearted bastard.

1870
02:50:09,645 --> 02:50:12,145
Want to know how many men
he had killed with Carlo?

1871
02:50:12,181 --> 02:50:13,926
Read the papers!
Read the papers!

1872
02:50:13,950 --> 02:50:16,450
That's your husband!
That's your husband!

1873
02:50:30,032 --> 02:50:32,532
Take her upstairs.

1874
02:50:32,568 --> 02:50:35,068
- Get her a doctor.
- Oh, God!

1875
02:50:55,124 --> 02:50:57,624
She's hysterical.

1876
02:51:01,564 --> 02:51:04,064
Hysterical.

1877
02:51:05,067 --> 02:51:07,567
Michael, is it true?

1878
02:51:09,005 --> 02:51:11,049
Don't ask me about my business, Kay.

1879
02:51:11,073 --> 02:51:14,565
- Is it true?
- Don't ask me about my business.

1880
02:51:14,677 --> 02:51:17,177
- No.
- Enough!

1881
02:51:35,564 --> 02:51:38,064
All right.

1882
02:51:39,869 --> 02:51:42,369
This one time.

1883
02:51:45,574 --> 02:51:48,074
This one time, I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1884
02:51:54,617 --> 02:51:57,117
Is it true?

1885
02:52:00,723 --> 02:52:03,223
Is it?

1886
02:52:03,524 --> 02:52:05,024
No.

1887
02:52:18,741 --> 02:52:21,119
I guess we both need a drink, huh?

1888
02:52:21,143 --> 02:52:23,643
Come on.

1889
02:52:53,209 --> 02:52:55,709
Don Corleone.
